A wonderfully weird mix of King's Field and classic Elder Scrolls, with a bit of Lovecraft/Cronenberg and a PSX aesthetic dashed in for flavor. 

[strike]I haven't spent much time in the early access release yet, but the demo I played way back when was excellent, and I can't wait to dive into the weird world of Dread Delusion.[/strike] If you enjoy mid-90's styled action RPGs, I think this will be right up your wobbly-textured alley.

The game starts fairly linearly, but after the initial introduction (roughly half an hour or so?), the map opens up significantly. You'll come across towns, merchants, NPCs, skill checks, and quests aplenty. There's a surprising amount of lore to the world, and a fairly straight-forward leveling system.

All-in-all, absolutely worth the $20 price if retro action RPGs and strange, almost alien, worlds are your thing.",1655329450,1655772985,True,41,0,0.789900243282318115,0,True,False,True,76561198010586084,439,8,914,914,714,1655990197,1574240.0
1,117130415,english,"Dread Delusions borrows ideas from many classic RPGs and blends them up into something lighter, more digestible for a modern audience. It’s like The End of Dyeus, but focused more on being an Elder Scrolls like. It might look like Morrowind, but it only has the depth of something like Skyrim. You wake up as a prisoner and quickly learn that most factions in the game are disliked. That being said the game world is incredibly engrossing and I enjoyed scouring each floating island for delusions, the things that level you up. However, that brings me to my one real complaint about the game so far – it’s incredibly shallow as of right now in Early Access. The gameplay loop is simple - seeing a building on the horizon, killing or sneaking past enemies on your way to the building. Then killing something in the building, charming someone in the building, or using lore to use switches. Then upstairs or downstairs there’s a delusion and a chest containing some sort of monitory loot. Of course, this doesn’t apply to every house or tower in the game, but it’s a majority of them. Later in the game you find yourself looking for ore to upgrade your armor and weapons, and some NPCs hint that you should check out the mines that dot the countryside. You get excited to explore some abandoned mines – only find out that they’re just a hallway and a single room with no enemies that sometimes spawns ore. It’s a great game world that just doesn’t have a lot of variation of activities right now. Still, these are minor complaints that I hope are addressed in later areas.

7,117048345,english,"There's clearly a lot here even without the game being fully finished. The tutorial aspects are kept short and sweet and although the game gives you loose directions on where to go next, you have a lot of freedom after getting the ability to enter new islands, which really help with promoting player exploration of the world. Systems I've encountered so far are kept relatively basic, which I think works in favor of what the game is aiming to be. 

Controls are a bit unconventional but a quick read of the controls settings and its very easy to understand and or rebind. I think this is still a good thing, because the game is clearly trying to be older in style. 

Combat is very straight forward, but I don't think it has to be this grand spectacle. Spells and potions are fun to use and provide enough variety that it stays engaging enough. And the ability to upgrade weapons and armor is a nice touch.

Quests are interesting and unique so far with characters being personally tied to the quests they give you and are fun little stories, and so far the lore of these islands is really interesting and the unique environments and contraptions you can find provide a lot of wonder as to what is happening. Shops are also really neat and each of them fit their roles. Leveling up the skills provides a direct correlation to whatever you want to be best at, which works very well.

A surreal nightmare world that is just breathing with character and depth, I mean you can see in the previews how this game looks, fantastic. I called it a sort of midquel between Daggerfall and Morrowind, the sort of older style of Daggerfall but the inspiration and alien world of Morrowind.

The gameplay is fun but simple, spells are super interesting, combat is dodging based, physically moving yourself around enemies attacks as you jump back in to try and land another hit.

The lore and world are very very interesting, like genuinely so unique and fun. A world where a god-hating Inquisition rules that have deemed religion heresy. There is so much beneath the surface to discover as well, and everytime I entered a new location something new was there to suck me in.

11,117141760,english,"I want to start off by saying that while I do not recommend this game, I want to see it succeed very badly. I've been excited for this game for a while now and I can't wait to see where it goes.

The visual style is beautiful with obvious inspirations such as TESIII Morrowind and a personal favorite of mine Arx Fatalis. The retro-style graphics options are a nice bonus and nicely give an old school feeling without feeling like too much or looking like lazy filters. The UI is crisp and compliments the PSX aesthetic nicely. Inspirations aside, it appears that Lovely Hellplace has done a great job at creating their own complex and interesting weird fantasy world.

The majority of gripes I've experienced are concerned with gameplay. When I think of great open world RPG's the favorite ones that come to mind incorporate freedom as early into the game as possible while allowing for seamless optional tutorials. For example: In TESIV Oblivion you quickly escape the sewers and are welcomed into a large open world that is fully explorable. BUT, when you are let out into the world the devolopers point the character straight to a small dungeon that is completely optional but the player is enticed to go there since it's already straight ahead and so close. In New Vegas you leave Doc Mitchell's house and can go wherever you would like. Many players go without realizing that Goodsprings is an optional tutorial disguised as part of the open world. These types of beginnings in games allow for significantly cleaner replayability allowing the player to choose if they want to complete that first Ayelid ruin, Goodsprings, or Seyda Neen. Dread Delusion felt as though it was going that direction and nearly has it nailed barring a few things. It would be great have other options of escaping from the initial island as it would help demonstrate how different options are always available. Perhaps smuggling yourself off of the island somehow? Maybe you forge a pass to get over the barred bridge? Find someone on the island willing to barter for a pass? There's so much potential with the start of the game I would love to see fleshed out.

The combat so far is not great. dodging is fairly useless as sprinting backwards to strafe and kite enemies is significantly more effective. The use of stamina in this game is not good. You're maximum stamina decreases it's size the more you use it. The only way to get it back is by resting. On paper it doesn't sound that bad until you realize your stamina bar is cut in half after defeating a single enemy. I won't dwell on this topic that much as I've already read a post that a developer replied to stating they are looking into improvements to the stamina system. Magic is unfortunately significantly weaker than melee. In my playthrough I put as many points as possible into making an optimal spellcaster and found that a missile spell that takes a chunk of MP did less damage to the games weakest enemy than a single sword swing with an empty stamina pool. This realistically means that if you want to have fun right now your best bet is to ignore your stamina bar and kite enemies with a melee build. I personally find that kiting enemies in melee is actually pretty fun, I just want there to be other optimal options to choose from for spellcasters. I did not play around with the stealth system so I have no comments on it. However, lockpicking is not very fun as it relies on dice rolls that are additional influenced by your main attributes and lockpicking. It would be far more fun and engaging to have a lockpicking minigame even if it's a rudimentary one.

Dread Delusion is in need of a sound overhaul. Ambient sounds are minimal with the few I've heard only being noticed while in bushes. Having more ambient noises to compliment the beautiful visual design would vastly improve immersion with the game world. Other sounds effects being added would be nice such as a sound for unsheathing your weapon, interacting with many game world objects, footsteps, heavy breathing at low stamina/exhaustion, one-liner dialogue when interacting with npc's (not full voice acting), player character grunting upon receiving heavy damage, etc.

There are of course bugs as with any early access release but I did not experience anything game breaking enough to warrant creating a new save file. The most irritating bug I experienced was an enemies model turning invisible during combat and having to fight them based on audio and their floating weapon.

Dread Delusion shows extreme promise and I have no doubt that the developers at Lovely Hellplace will be working hard at making their vision a reality. The developers are already answering numerous questions in the steam community so they clearly are taking input to heart. Unfortunately, as of now the game is not worth $20 and I think they should have released just the tutorial island as a free demo before releasing the game into early access.

Crafting items feels amazing so far. And talking to people is great; the dialogue is fairly organic and feels good to read through.
There are a couple things that could use a bit of adjustment. Fatigue seems to happen really fast; I like that it's a core mechanic, and I love that excessively using your stamina drains your max stamina, but it's pretty difficult to maintain at current level.

17,117055014,english,"I instantly fell in love with this game the moment I saw it pop up in my recommendation. The retro graphics, effects, and atmosphere melding together with surreal imagery and Lovecraftian horror makes for a strong visual foundation that itches my brain for exploring a lost forgotten game that was made back in the 90’s only for me to find in an attic 30 years later. I only recently started following the development for this project and the love and care that James Wragg to convince the player this is a living, breathing place of exploration and combat is inspiring. I’m highly anticipating this game’s full release, which is why I want to write this review to offer as much feedback as I can from my first experience to help this game grow to its fullest potential. This review may have some spoilers for events that happen in the game, so I will try my best to hide as much as possible that relates to a story, or just a cool moment I had.

I was engaged the moment [spoiler]I opened the cell doors to[/spoiler] begin my adventure in this bizarre colorful world. Though as I kept playing, I kept repeating the same statement over and over to myself when interacting with certain mechanics, which brings me to my first category of this review.

[h1]“Why won’t it just work?”[/h1]
As of 6/15/2022 I only have 3 hours in this game, and it’s very telling this is an early access release that has a lot of work needed to be completed. The foundation for a dynamic yet simple RPG elements are there but the cracks start to fold in when mechanics don’t really work as intended.

NPC do not follow you when asking them to follow you. They stand in place like a statue with no way to get them in gear.

Most, if not all hostile humanoid NPCs I interacted with do not move when attacked. They stand perfectly still and swing their weapons when I get close. The only ones that did move were surprisingly the bow and arrow bandits. 

All the monsters and non-human characters moved just find without any problem.

The Compass doesn’t work, and I was so sad when I sank my hard-earned gold into it just for the red needle not to move an inch.

Combat music for the first hour of the game was looping even when I wasn’t in combat. I had to mute the game’s music since it was so repetitive. It eventually stopped looping once I turned the music back on, but that lost me a lot of the immersion when settling into the world.

As of 6/15/2022 , those are the only notable bugs I encountered that breaks the games flow. These bugs were not frustrating, but more so a reminder that this is an indie game made by an individual and not a studio. Not everything is going to be perfect, and to demand perfection at this stage is not fair. However, there are a few questionable game mechanics in early game that slowly became a drag the longer I played. 
Which leads me to the next chapter:

[h1]“Fatigue is a drag and is not executed well early game.”[/h1]
Fatigue in this game is when your character gets physically tired resulting in attributes decreasing and your skills weakening. It’s harder to swing your sword, lockpick doors and chests, and speak to strangers using your charm. The longer you go without sleep and continue to drain fatigue by running, jumping, and attacking, the worse your stats get. Sleeping restored all stats and attributes just as expected. This mechanic was a welcome one in my first few hours of the game. It meant my character would need to find local inns, taverns, and cities to refuge at and gave me a reason to come back in to towns to check out shop items and see if there are new quests and secrets I missed. However, without knowing about [spoiler]Stamina potions[/spoiler] , you are completely reliant on [spoiler]spending mana to teleport to your last save point with the “hearthstone” spell you acquire in the first minutes of the game, which hopefully you set as the Wobblin Noggin inn since that is the only bed I was able to find after 3 hours of gameplay, then spending 2 coins each time you run out of fatigue and are forced to stop everything you was doing to go rest up if you are out of fatigue[/spoiler]. I assumed with a sleep mechanic I’d be able to stay in other’s beds, or abandoned beds that were left in the rubble of buildings. But none of the beds are interactable except for the one at the tavern. 

This becomes a non-issue later as you learn about [spoiler]Alchemy[/spoiler] and the ability to use the [spoiler]Academy’s teleporter system[/spoiler] , but having to pause everything you’re doing just to teleport back somewhere to pay 2 coins to refill a meter just to return back to that same spot to have enough charisma to talk to someone is… incredibly frustrating and time wasting. I hope that the Fatigue system is reworked or removed for something more traditional to depleting stamina. I am not a game designer and would not know a better replacement for such systems, but this was a big downer when trying to complete quests that required charm to progress early in the game’s beginner phase.

This game is early access. It is meant to be buggy right now because it’s a sneak peak at what’s to come. Despite the previously mentioned concerns above, I thoroughly enjoyed this game’s opening, the quests, and the world building revolved around it, and I can’t wait to play more when I get the chance. If you have the money to spare, PLEASE check out this game! The $20 price is worth it, and the value only grows as the game updates and receives all the fixes it deserves.

[b]I wish you good luck James Wragg![/b]

18,117421550,english,"I really like the idea of a non bethesda made first person rpg existing, and I like the artstyle and atmosphere of this game a lot, but there is a ton holding me back from appreciating this game in its current form, especially if it seems to explicitly hold as an aim capturing what makes those games compelling.

- The map is terrible. I know oldschool games had bad maps, but they were an accidental not essential component of them. In a game awash with misshapen technicolor mishmash, not having any way to concretely pin down locations or landmarks and your position relative to them is incredibly painful.

- I am not properly encouraged to engage with the world in any way other than vague quests or immediately visible collectibles. I understand wanting to make combat avoidance a viable way of progressing, but removing combat having any benefit at all, and making it so lockpicking, lore interactions, sneaking about etc. all do absolutely nothing, means I'm playing this game less like an open world arpg and more like Banjo Kazooie. 
The only way to progress is to collect Jiggies, and this is not fun both because it doesn't fit the game's intended playstyle and because I have no idea where they are other than ones I am apparently permanently content locked out of by not picking different stats.

- Combat is barebones, it's like modded daggerfall in a bad way. I circlekite and wait for space, then hit the enemy once or twice. Especially considering even the most basic enemies take 10+ hits, and I in no way improve in combat efficacy by fighting them, this makes the combat a chore. Yes there are charge attacks, and they do pretty much the same damage. There's simply not enough here to make it compelling, and as of yet no area I've encountered actually permits stealth combat as opposed to just stealth avoidance.

So this becomes my game experience thus far: 

I find myself aimlessly wandering around a mapless mishmash of color, making absolutely no progress of any kind regardless of how I interact with it. The world is bereft of cities, ruins, or locales, but merely has point of interest 'nodes' specked every so often. 

I come upon a POI node tower with a drunk soldier in it, my charisma check is too low to let me access the Jiggy held in the locked room below. The room is unlockpickable of course, and you are not allowed to kill or pickpocket him to get the key as characters don't have inventories and he's invincible for some reason. I make no progress and leave.

I begin wandering aimlessly again, I find another POI node with a wheelchair bound man with memory issues in it. There is a locked door upstairs that can only be opened by having enough book smarts to tug on candlesticks, meaning I can never access the precious Jiggy inside.
I go outside to a pillar and remember the man mentioning in bold that the pillar was made by people who hide things with illusion magic. I drink my truth seeing potion that specifically mentions that it interacts with such things that I found near a random lake nearby for absolutely no reason. Drinking the potion causes no changes to the pillar, it continues to not be interactable, but the sky changes color. The limited edition potion fades and the sky changes back. I make negative progress by wasting the potion and leave.

I come upon another POI node that is a tall tower with a Jiggy in the bottom again. The door at the bottom is unlockpickable as it is apparently barred from the inside. I prepare to leave, but then notice I might be able to get inside the top. I use my typically useless high agility stat to get 0 EXP by jumping up to a ledge to let me access the upstairs. Inside are three macguffins that require the lore stat to interact with, and no way of accessing the bottom of the tower with the Jiggy in it. I make no progress and leave.

I come upon a POI node with a wizard that has made several terrible spells and can't get into magic school. He tells me you need a letter of recommendation to get in. I get a quest telling me that people who can give letters of recommendation exist. Very oldschool, very cool. I make no progress and leave.

I visit what I vaguely remember is the lake area where I got the forbidden potion of truth seeing that did absolutely nothing at the designated use a truth seeing potion location. 
I decide to fight the giant version of a smaller enemy that lives there. After 10 minutes of waiting till he attacks then getting singular hits in, I get 0XP and he drops nothing. A notification appears onscreen telling me that Goblins, who already attack on sight, hate me more than usual now because I killed one of them that was big. I make negative progress and leave.

I do what I assume is backtracking but have no way to tell. I come upon a gap in two big rocks with an atheist soldier wandering about. He says I'm not cool enough to follow me around. I make no progress and leave.

I return to the POI node with drunk soldier inside, I have gained ore from somewhere now and want to try interacting with the previously useless furnace inside. The ore I have sucks and doesn't do anything. I make no progress and leave.

I wander aimlessly again. I continue to find arrows endlessly but no bow. I continue making no progress as nothing is lockpickable. I accidentally or on purpose retrace my steps constantly in a visually aggressive hellscape with no functioning map. I have not collected one single Jiggy aside from the one they use to explain what Jiggies are, I recall that I have not accomplished a single meaningful game act since the tutorial ended with the white haired lady saying my stat-penis was too small for me to be her sex slave.

21,117130415,english,"Dread Delusions borrows ideas from many classic RPGs and blends them up into something lighter, more digestible for a modern audience. It’s like The End of Dyeus, but focused more on being an Elder Scrolls like. It might look like Morrowind, but it only has the depth of something like Skyrim. You wake up as a prisoner and quickly learn that most factions in the game are disliked. That being said the game world is incredibly engrossing and I enjoyed scouring each floating island for delusions, the things that level you up. However, that brings me to my one real complaint about the game so far – it’s incredibly shallow as of right now in Early Access. The gameplay loop is simple - seeing a building on the horizon, killing or sneaking past enemies on your way to the building. Then killing something in the building, charming someone in the building, or using lore to use switches. Then upstairs or downstairs there’s a delusion and a chest containing some sort of monitory loot. Of course, this doesn’t apply to every house or tower in the game, but it’s a majority of them. Later in the game you find yourself looking for ore to upgrade your armor and weapons, and some NPCs hint that you should check out the mines that dot the countryside. You get excited to explore some abandoned mines – only find out that they’re just a hallway and a single room with no enemies that sometimes spawns ore. It’s a great game world that just doesn’t have a lot of variation of activities right now. Still, these are minor complaints that I hope are addressed in later areas.

Systems I've encountered so far are kept relatively basic, which I think works in favor of what the game is aiming to be. 

Controls are a bit unconventional but a quick read of the controls settings and its very easy to understand and or rebind. I think this is still a good thing, because the game is clearly trying to be older in style. 

Combat is very straight forward, but I don't think it has to be this grand spectacle. Spells and potions are fun to use and provide enough variety that it stays engaging enough. And the ability to upgrade weapons and armor is a nice touch.

Quests are interesting and unique so far with characters being personally tied to the quests they give you and are fun little stories, and so far the lore of these islands is really interesting and the unique environments and contraptions you can find provide a lot of wonder as to what is happening. Shops are also really neat and each of them fit their roles. Leveling up the skills provides a direct correlation to whatever you want to be best at, which works very well.

The gameplay is fun but simple, spells are super interesting, combat is dodging based, physically moving yourself around enemies attacks as you jump back in to try and land another hit.

31,117141760,english,"I want to start off by saying that while I do not recommend this game, I want to see it succeed very badly. I've been excited for this game for a while now and I can't wait to see where it goes.

The visual style is beautiful with obvious inspirations such as TESIII Morrowind and a personal favorite of mine Arx Fatalis. The retro-style graphics options are a nice bonus and nicely give an old school feeling without feeling like too much or looking like lazy filters. The UI is crisp and compliments the PSX aesthetic nicely. Inspirations aside, it appears that Lovely Hellplace has done a great job at creating their own complex and interesting weird fantasy world.

The majority of gripes I've experienced are concerned with gameplay. When I think of great open world RPG's the favorite ones that come to mind incorporate freedom as early into the game as possible while allowing for seamless optional tutorials. For example: In TESIV Oblivion you quickly escape the sewers and are welcomed into a large open world that is fully explorable. BUT, when you are let out into the world the devolopers point the character straight to a small dungeon that is completely optional but the player is enticed to go there since it's already straight ahead and so close. In New Vegas you leave Doc Mitchell's house and can go wherever you would like. Many players go without realizing that Goodsprings is an optional tutorial disguised as part of the open world. These types of beginnings in games allow for significantly cleaner replayability allowing the player to choose if they want to complete that first Ayelid ruin, Goodsprings, or Seyda Neen. Dread Delusion felt as though it was going that direction and nearly has it nailed barring a few things. It would be great have other options of escaping from the initial island as it would help demonstrate how different options are always available. Perhaps smuggling yourself off of the island somehow? Maybe you forge a pass to get over the barred bridge? Find someone on the island willing to barter for a pass? There's so much potential with the start of the game I would love to see fleshed out.

The combat so far is not great. dodging is fairly useless as sprinting backwards to strafe and kite enemies is significantly more effective. The use of stamina in this game is not good. You're maximum stamina decreases it's size the more you use it. The only way to get it back is by resting. On paper it doesn't sound that bad until you realize your stamina bar is cut in half after defeating a single enemy. I won't dwell on this topic that much as I've already read a post that a developer replied to stating they are looking into improvements to the stamina system. Magic is unfortunately significantly weaker than melee. In my playthrough I put as many points as possible into making an optimal spellcaster and found that a missile spell that takes a chunk of MP did less damage to the games weakest enemy than a single sword swing with an empty stamina pool. This realistically means that if you want to have fun right now your best bet is to ignore your stamina bar and kite enemies with a melee build. I personally find that kiting enemies in melee is actually pretty fun, I just want there to be other optimal options to choose from for spellcasters. I did not play around with the stealth system so I have no comments on it. However, lockpicking is not very fun as it relies on dice rolls that are additional influenced by your main attributes and lockpicking. It would be far more fun and engaging to have a lockpicking minigame even if it's a rudimentary one.

Dread Delusion is in need of a sound overhaul. Ambient sounds are minimal with the few I've heard only being noticed while in bushes. Having more ambient noises to compliment the beautiful visual design would vastly improve immersion with the game world. Other sounds effects being added would be nice such as a sound for unsheathing your weapon, interacting with many game world objects, footsteps, heavy breathing at low stamina/exhaustion, one-liner dialogue when interacting with npc's (not full voice acting), player character grunting upon receiving heavy damage, etc.

There are of course bugs as with any early access release but I did not experience anything game breaking enough to warrant creating a new save file. The most irritating bug I experienced was an enemies model turning invisible during combat and having to fight them based on audio and their floating weapon.

Dread Delusion shows extreme promise and I have no doubt that the developers at Lovely Hellplace will be working hard at making their vision a reality. The developers are already answering numerous questions in the steam community so they clearly are taking input to heart. Unfortunately, as of now the game is not worth $20 and I think they should have released just the tutorial island as a free demo before releasing the game into early access.

There are a couple things that could use a bit of adjustment. Fatigue seems to happen really fast; I like that it's a core mechanic, and I love that excessively using your stamina drains your max stamina, but it's pretty difficult to maintain at current level.

37,117055014,english,"I instantly fell in love with this game the moment I saw it pop up in my recommendation. The retro graphics, effects, and atmosphere melding together with surreal imagery and Lovecraftian horror makes for a strong visual foundation that itches my brain for exploring a lost forgotten game that was made back in the 90’s only for me to find in an attic 30 years later. I only recently started following the development for this project and the love and care that James Wragg to convince the player this is a living, breathing place of exploration and combat is inspiring. I’m highly anticipating this game’s full release, which is why I want to write this review to offer as much feedback as I can from my first experience to help this game grow to its fullest potential. This review may have some spoilers for events that happen in the game, so I will try my best to hide as much as possible that relates to a story, or just a cool moment I had.

I was engaged the moment [spoiler]I opened the cell doors to[/spoiler] begin my adventure in this bizarre colorful world. Though as I kept playing, I kept repeating the same statement over and over to myself when interacting with certain mechanics, which brings me to my first category of this review.

[h1]“Why won’t it just work?”[/h1]
As of 6/15/2022 I only have 3 hours in this game, and it’s very telling this is an early access release that has a lot of work needed to be completed. The foundation for a dynamic yet simple RPG elements are there but the cracks start to fold in when mechanics don’t really work as intended.

NPC do not follow you when asking them to follow you. They stand in place like a statue with no way to get them in gear.

Most, if not all hostile humanoid NPCs I interacted with do not move when attacked. They stand perfectly still and swing their weapons when I get close. The only ones that did move were surprisingly the bow and arrow bandits. 

All the monsters and non-human characters moved just find without any problem.

The Compass doesn’t work, and I was so sad when I sank my hard-earned gold into it just for the red needle not to move an inch.

Combat music for the first hour of the game was looping even when I wasn’t in combat. I had to mute the game’s music since it was so repetitive. It eventually stopped looping once I turned the music back on, but that lost me a lot of the immersion when settling into the world.

As of 6/15/2022 , those are the only notable bugs I encountered that breaks the games flow. These bugs were not frustrating, but more so a reminder that this is an indie game made by an individual and not a studio. Not everything is going to be perfect, and to demand perfection at this stage is not fair. However, there are a few questionable game mechanics in early game that slowly became a drag the longer I played. 
Which leads me to the next chapter:

[h1]“Fatigue is a drag and is not executed well early game.”[/h1]
Fatigue in this game is when your character gets physically tired resulting in attributes decreasing and your skills weakening. It’s harder to swing your sword, lockpick doors and chests, and speak to strangers using your charm. The longer you go without sleep and continue to drain fatigue by running, jumping, and attacking, the worse your stats get. Sleeping restored all stats and attributes just as expected. This mechanic was a welcome one in my first few hours of the game. It meant my character would need to find local inns, taverns, and cities to refuge at and gave me a reason to come back in to towns to check out shop items and see if there are new quests and secrets I missed. However, without knowing about [spoiler]Stamina potions[/spoiler] , you are completely reliant on [spoiler]spending mana to teleport to your last save point with the “hearthstone” spell you acquire in the first minutes of the game, which hopefully you set as the Wobblin Noggin inn since that is the only bed I was able to find after 3 hours of gameplay, then spending 2 coins each time you run out of fatigue and are forced to stop everything you was doing to go rest up if you are out of fatigue[/spoiler]. I assumed with a sleep mechanic I’d be able to stay in other’s beds, or abandoned beds that were left in the rubble of buildings. But none of the beds are interactable except for the one at the tavern. 

This becomes a non-issue later as you learn about [spoiler]Alchemy[/spoiler] and the ability to use the [spoiler]Academy’s teleporter system[/spoiler] , but having to pause everything you’re doing just to teleport back somewhere to pay 2 coins to refill a meter just to return back to that same spot to have enough charisma to talk to someone is… incredibly frustrating and time wasting. I hope that the Fatigue system is reworked or removed for something more traditional to depleting stamina. I am not a game designer and would not know a better replacement for such systems, but this was a big downer when trying to complete quests that required charm to progress early in the game’s beginner phase.

This game is early access. It is meant to be buggy right now because it’s a sneak peak at what’s to come. Despite the previously mentioned concerns above, I thoroughly enjoyed this game’s opening, the quests, and the world building revolved around it, and I can’t wait to play more when I get the chance. If you have the money to spare, PLEASE check out this game! The $20 price is worth it, and the value only grows as the game updates and receives all the fixes it deserves.

- The map is terrible. I know oldschool games had bad maps, but they were an accidental not essential component of them. In a game awash with misshapen technicolor mishmash, not having any way to concretely pin down locations or landmarks and your position relative to them is incredibly painful.

- I am not properly encouraged to engage with the world in any way other than vague quests or immediately visible collectibles. I understand wanting to make combat avoidance a viable way of progressing, but removing combat having any benefit at all, and making it so lockpicking, lore interactions, sneaking about etc. all do absolutely nothing, means I'm playing this game less like an open world arpg and more like Banjo Kazooie. 
The only way to progress is to collect Jiggies, and this is not fun both because it doesn't fit the game's intended playstyle and because I have no idea where they are other than ones I am apparently permanently content locked out of by not picking different stats.

- Combat is barebones, it's like modded daggerfall in a bad way. I circlekite and wait for space, then hit the enemy once or twice. Especially considering even the most basic enemies take 10+ hits, and I in no way improve in combat efficacy by fighting them, this makes the combat a chore. Yes there are charge attacks, and they do pretty much the same damage. There's simply not enough here to make it compelling, and as of yet no area I've encountered actually permits stealth combat as opposed to just stealth avoidance.

So this becomes my game experience thus far: 

I find myself aimlessly wandering around a mapless mishmash of color, making absolutely no progress of any kind regardless of how I interact with it. The world is bereft of cities, ruins, or locales, but merely has point of interest 'nodes' specked every so often. 

I come upon a POI node tower with a drunk soldier in it, my charisma check is too low to let me access the Jiggy held in the locked room below. The room is unlockpickable of course, and you are not allowed to kill or pickpocket him to get the key as characters don't have inventories and he's invincible for some reason. I make no progress and leave.

I begin wandering aimlessly again, I find another POI node with a wheelchair bound man with memory issues in it. There is a locked door upstairs that can only be opened by having enough book smarts to tug on candlesticks, meaning I can never access the precious Jiggy inside.
I go outside to a pillar and remember the man mentioning in bold that the pillar was made by people who hide things with illusion magic. I drink my truth seeing potion that specifically mentions that it interacts with such things that I found near a random lake nearby for absolutely no reason. Drinking the potion causes no changes to the pillar, it continues to not be interactable, but the sky changes color. The limited edition potion fades and the sky changes back. I make negative progress by wasting the potion and leave.

I come upon another POI node that is a tall tower with a Jiggy in the bottom again. The door at the bottom is unlockpickable as it is apparently barred from the inside. I prepare to leave, but then notice I might be able to get inside the top. I use my typically useless high agility stat to get 0 EXP by jumping up to a ledge to let me access the upstairs. Inside are three macguffins that require the lore stat to interact with, and no way of accessing the bottom of the tower with the Jiggy in it. I make no progress and leave.

I come upon a POI node with a wizard that has made several terrible spells and can't get into magic school. He tells me you need a letter of recommendation to get in. I get a quest telling me that people who can give letters of recommendation exist. Very oldschool, very cool. I make no progress and leave.

I visit what I vaguely remember is the lake area where I got the forbidden potion of truth seeing that did absolutely nothing at the designated use a truth seeing potion location. 
I decide to fight the giant version of a smaller enemy that lives there. After 10 minutes of waiting till he attacks then getting singular hits in, I get 0XP and he drops nothing. A notification appears onscreen telling me that Goblins, who already attack on sight, hate me more than usual now because I killed one of them that was big. I make negative progress and leave.

I do what I assume is backtracking but have no way to tell. I come upon a gap in two big rocks with an atheist soldier wandering about. He says I'm not cool enough to follow me around. I make no progress and leave.

I return to the POI node with drunk soldier inside, I have gained ore from somewhere now and want to try interacting with the previously useless furnace inside. The ore I have sucks and doesn't do anything. I make no progress and leave.

I wander aimlessly again. I continue to find arrows endlessly but no bow. I continue making no progress as nothing is lockpickable. I accidentally or on purpose retrace my steps constantly in a visually aggressive hellscape with no functioning map. I have not collected one single Jiggy aside from the one they use to explain what Jiggies are, I recall that I have not accomplished a single meaningful game act since the tutorial ended with the white haired lady saying my stat-penis was too small for me to be her sex slave.

Pros:
- World is well crafted and interesting to explore
- Good writing and compelling story
- Plenty of stuff to do and see
- Quests have different choices and are decently fun

Cons:
- Combat is trivial and not very engaging. Magic and Bows do so little damage they're worthless, Melee melts through any enemy without even upgrading the Strength-stat.

Audio is alright, but the repetitive music is on a short loop. I suppose my biggest criticism so far is the audio, as it feels like it repeats every 15 seconds depending on the area you're in.

It’s like The End of Dyeus, but focused more on being an Elder Scrolls like. It might look like Morrowind, but it only has the depth of something like Skyrim. You wake up as a prisoner and quickly learn that most factions in the game are disliked. That being said the game world is incredibly engrossing and I enjoyed scouring each floating island for delusions, the things that level you up. However, that brings me to my one real complaint about the game so far – it’s incredibly shallow as of right now in Early Access. The gameplay loop is simple - seeing a building on the horizon, killing or sneaking past enemies on your way to the building. Then killing something in the building, charming someone in the building, or using lore to use switches. Then upstairs or downstairs there’s a delusion and a chest containing some sort of monitory loot. Of course, this doesn’t apply to every house or tower in the game, but it’s a majority of them. Later in the game you find yourself looking for ore to upgrade your armor and weapons, and some NPCs hint that you should check out the mines that dot the countryside. You get excited to explore some abandoned mines – only find out that they’re just a hallway and a single room with no enemies that sometimes spawns ore. It’s a great game world that just doesn’t have a lot of variation of activities right now. Still, these are minor complaints that I hope are addressed in later areas.

Systems I've encountered so far are kept relatively basic, which I think works in favor of what the game is aiming to be. 

Controls are a bit unconventional but a quick read of the controls settings and its very easy to understand and or rebind. I think this is still a good thing, because the game is clearly trying to be older in style. 

Combat is very straight forward, but I don't think it has to be this grand spectacle. Spells and potions are fun to use and provide enough variety that it stays engaging enough. And the ability to upgrade weapons and armor is a nice touch.

Quests are interesting and unique so far with characters being personally tied to the quests they give you and are fun little stories, and so far the lore of these islands is really interesting and the unique environments and contraptions you can find provide a lot of wonder as to what is happening. Shops are also really neat and each of them fit their roles. Leveling up the skills provides a direct correlation to whatever you want to be best at, which works very well.

I called it a sort of midquel between Daggerfall and Morrowind, the sort of older style of Daggerfall but the inspiration and alien world of Morrowind.

The gameplay is fun but simple, spells are super interesting, combat is dodging based, physically moving yourself around enemies attacks as you jump back in to try and land another hit.

The lore and world are very very interesting, like genuinely so unique and fun. A world where a god-hating Inquisition rules that have deemed religion heresy.

77,117141760,english,"I want to start off by saying that while I do not recommend this game, I want to see it succeed very badly. I've been excited for this game for a while now and I can't wait to see where it goes.

The visual style is beautiful with obvious inspirations such as TESIII Morrowind and a personal favorite of mine Arx Fatalis. The retro-style graphics options are a nice bonus and nicely give an old school feeling without feeling like too much or looking like lazy filters. The UI is crisp and compliments the PSX aesthetic nicely. Inspirations aside, it appears that Lovely Hellplace has done a great job at creating their own complex and interesting weird fantasy world.

The majority of gripes I've experienced are concerned with gameplay. When I think of great open world RPG's the favorite ones that come to mind incorporate freedom as early into the game as possible while allowing for seamless optional tutorials. For example: In TESIV Oblivion you quickly escape the sewers and are welcomed into a large open world that is fully explorable. BUT, when you are let out into the world the devolopers point the character straight to a small dungeon that is completely optional but the player is enticed to go there since it's already straight ahead and so close. In New Vegas you leave Doc Mitchell's house and can go wherever you would like. Many players go without realizing that Goodsprings is an optional tutorial disguised as part of the open world. These types of beginnings in games allow for significantly cleaner replayability allowing the player to choose if they want to complete that first Ayelid ruin, Goodsprings, or Seyda Neen. Dread Delusion felt as though it was going that direction and nearly has it nailed barring a few things. It would be great have other options of escaping from the initial island as it would help demonstrate how different options are always available. Perhaps smuggling yourself off of the island somehow? Maybe you forge a pass to get over the barred bridge? Find someone on the island willing to barter for a pass? There's so much potential with the start of the game I would love to see fleshed out.

The combat so far is not great. dodging is fairly useless as sprinting backwards to strafe and kite enemies is significantly more effective. The use of stamina in this game is not good. You're maximum stamina decreases it's size the more you use it. The only way to get it back is by resting. On paper it doesn't sound that bad until you realize your stamina bar is cut in half after defeating a single enemy. I won't dwell on this topic that much as I've already read a post that a developer replied to stating they are looking into improvements to the stamina system. Magic is unfortunately significantly weaker than melee. In my playthrough I put as many points as possible into making an optimal spellcaster and found that a missile spell that takes a chunk of MP did less damage to the games weakest enemy than a single sword swing with an empty stamina pool. This realistically means that if you want to have fun right now your best bet is to ignore your stamina bar and kite enemies with a melee build. I personally find that kiting enemies in melee is actually pretty fun, I just want there to be other optimal options to choose from for spellcasters. I did not play around with the stealth system so I have no comments on it. However, lockpicking is not very fun as it relies on dice rolls that are additional influenced by your main attributes and lockpicking. It would be far more fun and engaging to have a lockpicking minigame even if it's a rudimentary one.

Dread Delusion is in need of a sound overhaul. Ambient sounds are minimal with the few I've heard only being noticed while in bushes. Having more ambient noises to compliment the beautiful visual design would vastly improve immersion with the game world. Other sounds effects being added would be nice such as a sound for unsheathing your weapon, interacting with many game world objects, footsteps, heavy breathing at low stamina/exhaustion, one-liner dialogue when interacting with npc's (not full voice acting), player character grunting upon receiving heavy damage, etc.

There are of course bugs as with any early access release but I did not experience anything game breaking enough to warrant creating a new save file. The most irritating bug I experienced was an enemies model turning invisible during combat and having to fight them based on audio and their floating weapon.

Dread Delusion shows extreme promise and I have no doubt that the developers at Lovely Hellplace will be working hard at making their vision a reality. The developers are already answering numerous questions in the steam community so they clearly are taking input to heart. Unfortunately, as of now the game is not worth $20 and I think they should have released just the tutorial island as a free demo before releasing the game into early access.

There are a couple things that could use a bit of adjustment. Fatigue seems to happen really fast; I like that it's a core mechanic, and I love that excessively using your stamina drains your max stamina, but it's pretty difficult to maintain at current level.

83,117055014,english,"I instantly fell in love with this game the moment I saw it pop up in my recommendation. The retro graphics, effects, and atmosphere melding together with surreal imagery and Lovecraftian horror makes for a strong visual foundation that itches my brain for exploring a lost forgotten game that was made back in the 90’s only for me to find in an attic 30 years later. I only recently started following the development for this project and the love and care that James Wragg to convince the player this is a living, breathing place of exploration and combat is inspiring. I’m highly anticipating this game’s full release, which is why I want to write this review to offer as much feedback as I can from my first experience to help this game grow to its fullest potential. This review may have some spoilers for events that happen in the game, so I will try my best to hide as much as possible that relates to a story, or just a cool moment I had.

I was engaged the moment [spoiler]I opened the cell doors to[/spoiler] begin my adventure in this bizarre colorful world. Though as I kept playing, I kept repeating the same statement over and over to myself when interacting with certain mechanics, which brings me to my first category of this review.

[h1]“Why won’t it just work?”[/h1]
As of 6/15/2022 I only have 3 hours in this game, and it’s very telling this is an early access release that has a lot of work needed to be completed. The foundation for a dynamic yet simple RPG elements are there but the cracks start to fold in when mechanics don’t really work as intended.

NPC do not follow you when asking them to follow you. They stand in place like a statue with no way to get them in gear.

Most, if not all hostile humanoid NPCs I interacted with do not move when attacked. They stand perfectly still and swing their weapons when I get close. The only ones that did move were surprisingly the bow and arrow bandits. 

All the monsters and non-human characters moved just find without any problem.

The Compass doesn’t work, and I was so sad when I sank my hard-earned gold into it just for the red needle not to move an inch.

Combat music for the first hour of the game was looping even when I wasn’t in combat. I had to mute the game’s music since it was so repetitive. It eventually stopped looping once I turned the music back on, but that lost me a lot of the immersion when settling into the world.

As of 6/15/2022 , those are the only notable bugs I encountered that breaks the games flow. These bugs were not frustrating, but more so a reminder that this is an indie game made by an individual and not a studio. Not everything is going to be perfect, and to demand perfection at this stage is not fair. However, there are a few questionable game mechanics in early game that slowly became a drag the longer I played. 
Which leads me to the next chapter:

[h1]“Fatigue is a drag and is not executed well early game.”[/h1]
Fatigue in this game is when your character gets physically tired resulting in attributes decreasing and your skills weakening. It’s harder to swing your sword, lockpick doors and chests, and speak to strangers using your charm. The longer you go without sleep and continue to drain fatigue by running, jumping, and attacking, the worse your stats get. Sleeping restored all stats and attributes just as expected. This mechanic was a welcome one in my first few hours of the game. It meant my character would need to find local inns, taverns, and cities to refuge at and gave me a reason to come back in to towns to check out shop items and see if there are new quests and secrets I missed. However, without knowing about [spoiler]Stamina potions[/spoiler] , you are completely reliant on [spoiler]spending mana to teleport to your last save point with the “hearthstone” spell you acquire in the first minutes of the game, which hopefully you set as the Wobblin Noggin inn since that is the only bed I was able to find after 3 hours of gameplay, then spending 2 coins each time you run out of fatigue and are forced to stop everything you was doing to go rest up if you are out of fatigue[/spoiler]. I assumed with a sleep mechanic I’d be able to stay in other’s beds, or abandoned beds that were left in the rubble of buildings. But none of the beds are interactable except for the one at the tavern. 

This becomes a non-issue later as you learn about [spoiler]Alchemy[/spoiler] and the ability to use the [spoiler]Academy’s teleporter system[/spoiler] , but having to pause everything you’re doing just to teleport back somewhere to pay 2 coins to refill a meter just to return back to that same spot to have enough charisma to talk to someone is… incredibly frustrating and time wasting. I hope that the Fatigue system is reworked or removed for something more traditional to depleting stamina. I am not a game designer and would not know a better replacement for such systems, but this was a big downer when trying to complete quests that required charm to progress early in the game’s beginner phase.

This game is early access. It is meant to be buggy right now because it’s a sneak peak at what’s to come. Despite the previously mentioned concerns above, I thoroughly enjoyed this game’s opening, the quests, and the world building revolved around it, and I can’t wait to play more when I get the chance. If you have the money to spare, PLEASE check out this game! The $20 price is worth it, and the value only grows as the game updates and receives all the fixes it deserves.

[b]I wish you good luck James Wragg![/b]

84,117421550,english,"I really like the idea of a non bethesda made first person rpg existing, and I like the artstyle and atmosphere of this game a lot, but there is a ton holding me back from appreciating this game in its current form, especially if it seems to explicitly hold as an aim capturing what makes those games compelling.

- The map is terrible. I know oldschool games had bad maps, but they were an accidental not essential component of them. In a game awash with misshapen technicolor mishmash, not having any way to concretely pin down locations or landmarks and your position relative to them is incredibly painful.

- I am not properly encouraged to engage with the world in any way other than vague quests or immediately visible collectibles. I understand wanting to make combat avoidance a viable way of progressing, but removing combat having any benefit at all, and making it so lockpicking, lore interactions, sneaking about etc. all do absolutely nothing, means I'm playing this game less like an open world arpg and more like Banjo Kazooie. 
The only way to progress is to collect Jiggies, and this is not fun both because it doesn't fit the game's intended playstyle and because I have no idea where they are other than ones I am apparently permanently content locked out of by not picking different stats.

- Combat is barebones, it's like modded daggerfall in a bad way. I circlekite and wait for space, then hit the enemy once or twice. Especially considering even the most basic enemies take 10+ hits, and I in no way improve in combat efficacy by fighting them, this makes the combat a chore. Yes there are charge attacks, and they do pretty much the same damage. There's simply not enough here to make it compelling, and as of yet no area I've encountered actually permits stealth combat as opposed to just stealth avoidance.

So this becomes my game experience thus far: 

I find myself aimlessly wandering around a mapless mishmash of color, making absolutely no progress of any kind regardless of how I interact with it. The world is bereft of cities, ruins, or locales, but merely has point of interest 'nodes' specked every so often. 

I come upon a POI node tower with a drunk soldier in it, my charisma check is too low to let me access the Jiggy held in the locked room below. The room is unlockpickable of course, and you are not allowed to kill or pickpocket him to get the key as characters don't have inventories and he's invincible for some reason. I make no progress and leave.

I begin wandering aimlessly again, I find another POI node with a wheelchair bound man with memory issues in it. There is a locked door upstairs that can only be opened by having enough book smarts to tug on candlesticks, meaning I can never access the precious Jiggy inside.
I go outside to a pillar and remember the man mentioning in bold that the pillar was made by people who hide things with illusion magic. I drink my truth seeing potion that specifically mentions that it interacts with such things that I found near a random lake nearby for absolutely no reason. Drinking the potion causes no changes to the pillar, it continues to not be interactable, but the sky changes color. The limited edition potion fades and the sky changes back. I make negative progress by wasting the potion and leave.

I come upon another POI node that is a tall tower with a Jiggy in the bottom again. The door at the bottom is unlockpickable as it is apparently barred from the inside. I prepare to leave, but then notice I might be able to get inside the top. I use my typically useless high agility stat to get 0 EXP by jumping up to a ledge to let me access the upstairs. Inside are three macguffins that require the lore stat to interact with, and no way of accessing the bottom of the tower with the Jiggy in it. I make no progress and leave.

I come upon a POI node with a wizard that has made several terrible spells and can't get into magic school. He tells me you need a letter of recommendation to get in. I get a quest telling me that people who can give letters of recommendation exist. Very oldschool, very cool. I make no progress and leave.

I visit what I vaguely remember is the lake area where I got the forbidden potion of truth seeing that did absolutely nothing at the designated use a truth seeing potion location. 
I decide to fight the giant version of a smaller enemy that lives there. After 10 minutes of waiting till he attacks then getting singular hits in, I get 0XP and he drops nothing. A notification appears onscreen telling me that Goblins, who already attack on sight, hate me more than usual now because I killed one of them that was big. I make negative progress and leave.

I do what I assume is backtracking but have no way to tell. I come upon a gap in two big rocks with an atheist soldier wandering about. He says I'm not cool enough to follow me around. I make no progress and leave.

I return to the POI node with drunk soldier inside, I have gained ore from somewhere now and want to try interacting with the previously useless furnace inside. The ore I have sucks and doesn't do anything. I make no progress and leave.

Pros:
- World is well crafted and interesting to explore
- Good writing and compelling story
- Plenty of stuff to do and see
- Quests have different choices and are decently fun

Cons:
- Combat is trivial and not very engaging. Magic and Bows do so little damage they're worthless, Melee melts through any enemy without even upgrading the Strength-stat.
- Loot isn't very well balanced and there's not a lot to spend coin or materials on. You end up with way too many potions and lockpicks

Like navigating a nightmare, the visuals are a bad trip after reading Gothic Horror and Lovecraft.

The atmospheric feel cannot be understated.  

The lore and dialogue are alright. They probably need to polish this area as recycling and combining cliches doesn't exactly create a memorable experience. 

Audio is alright, but the repetitive music is on a short loop. I suppose my biggest criticism so far is the audio, as it feels like it repeats every 15 seconds depending on the area you're in.

As mentioned above, the experience is very similar to Morrowind; this holds true for the combat as well. Fairly easy to master, this grows fairly repetitive after the first few encounters. It is currently unbalanced in favoring a melee build but it appears that will change. 

There's clearly some kinks that needed to be worked out (lag time of enemy drops, enemies disappearing, items not working) but all things considered the game is still enjoyable even in early access.

Stamina seems to not affect anything as far as I can tell, charging my swings never felt like it did more damage, I had more health potions than I could ever use, and enemy moves are telegraphed so hard that an old man could dodge them, but you're not an old man, you're Sonic the damn Hedgehog well before you even level Agility, you can outrun anyone without even pressing the shift key.

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
Pyreside is just a small village that is connected by a long bridge and thick woods. Despite having to explore the same areas throughout the years, you will notice some differences from time to time. New trees will grow in the woods, bedrooms will change based on the people who sleep there - there is always something worthy to note. What amazes me the most is when the game sets in winter. There aren't any paths that look obvious at first, but you'll instinctively know where to go since you have traversed the same path several times. The lighting helps to make the scene look dreamy and heartwarming at the same time, and the use of the blurred image of the town as a background indoors does a good job to make the scene look more beautiful. All in all, I liked the aesthetic approaches that are used in the game.

[h3]Story[/h3]
Meet Lyric. She was born as a child of an innkeeper, in a small mountain village called Pyreside. The outside is dangerous with monsters roaming around, so she never ventures outside. If this is another game, she'll be a hero that saves the world, but this isn't it. She's no fighter, and never will be. She only knows how to serve people, wash blankets, and talk to other villagers just like any other innkeeper. The game tries to emphasize more on that feeling, expressing how blessed she is with her life.

Although the premise sounds boring, the execution isn't. Poetic words fill the whole narrative, sending a brief, subtle message about what was happening. The voice dub is also brilliant - it brings weight to the narrative with the emotions showing up in it. The relaxing piano music portrays the slow-paced world perfectly, and just like the voice dub, the tune fits well with the atmosphere: cheerful times are accompanied by a strong, cheerful tune, while darker times are portrayed with a lower, subtle tune. My spirit was always lifted whenever the piano sound shifts into a more cheerful one. The combinations of these aspects help to bring the story to a greater height, showing the proper emotions when the time is right.

[i]Wayward Prophet[/i] did an excellent job in creating a heartwarming story in [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/432010/Worlds_Dawn/]World's Dawn[/url][/b] ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198132503739/recommended/432010]my review[/url]), and [b]A Story Beside[/b] isn't any different. The story is a slow-paced one, full of heartwarming moments. You'll see how things and people change throughout the years: someone who looks grumpy all the time will eventually learn how to smile, characters being more mature as they grow up, things like that. What makes it more special is that the change doesn't feel forced at all. The main character will change her mindset as she talks to more people throughout the years, appreciates more what others did, and most importantly, cherishes the lives that matter to her the most. It's a sort of story that can make you feel emotional all the time.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
As a story-heavy game, there isn't much to say about the gameplay. The game is divided into 7 chapters, where seven years passed between each one except the last. Each chapter lasts for one or several in-game days, which translates to around an hour in real life. Since the game is set in a village, you'll have to explore the same areas all the time, talking to all villagers and the interactable objects that you can find in every chapter. This can be annoying sometimes, especially since the main character has a slow walking speed. Some events will also require you to pick up objects lying on the ground, which are easy to find due to their blinking color.

There is a QTE in the game, but the delay between each action is very long. You don't have to worry about not being fast enough to press the button. Besides, there is no penalty - you can always press the buttons until you succeed.

I'm amazed at the amount of story branching that the game has. The changes are minimal, but that's the charm of the game: it's up to you to shape the story. Your decision will change a lot of things, whether it's your life or others, for the better or worse. Although some choices will take effect right away, others are more subtle, showing their repercussions a few chapters after. It's what I liked about the game the most. You need to pay attention to everything that the game has to offer and think of the possibilities.

[b]Length and Replayability[/b]
I finished the game in 7.9h, but I missed 2 achievements back then. The game offers a lot of replayability values from the story branching - I did try to play the game more after obtaining all achievements, but there are still a lot of possibilities that I can explore. However, the game doesn't seem to be designed with replayability in mind. Despite having a chapter select, there isn't a way to skip the cutscenes and you still have to deal with the slow walking speed. It fits with the slow-paced story, though. Somehow, I ended up appreciating the story more because of them.

[b]Others[/b]
Chapter select is only accessible after you load a save, which can be problematic if you accidentally load a save with a cutscene. There is also a chance of the game freezing after you alt-tab a lot, although it shouldn't be a problem as long as you save the game often.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]A Story Beside[/b] is such a wonderful story to be had. The story gives a heartwarming feel to it, letting you appreciate whatever you have in the village. I ended up loving each character by the end of the story, even the one that I hated at first. Its message is delivered clearly, and the slow-paced story helps to set it up brilliantly. Those who enjoy heartwarming, emotional stories will enjoy the game, although I don't think it will appeal to others. Try checking the game's trailer - if you like it, especially the music, you won't be disappointed.

The game pulls off its concept well, offering you the chance to experience an adventure RPG world from the perspective of someone else - an innkeeper of a small village of relatively little significance to the world. But to her, that village [i]IS[/i] the world. The decisions she makes throughout her life alters the village in small, yet notable ways.

Each chapter is a different part of Lyric's life, advancing years between each story. You often get choices in conversation and action, some of which are insignificant, some which can alter how the future plays out. I was invested enough to legitimately agonize over a choice or two, wondering if what I was doing was truly for the best. At the end of each chapter, you are given a summary of the choices you made, including ones you missed entirely. It made me very curious to try another playthrough to see how different things can end up.

Presentation is fantastic; the first chapter especially gives a great first impression with visuals and sound to immerse you in this fantasy world. Some parts are narrated by Lyric herself, and the voice acting is on point with feeling and with framing the current scene. One of my favorite details is the long, desolate bridge to the outside world. Most of the time, it's the only screen with a different perspective, with ominous sound effects and lack of music. It really encapsulates the intimidating feeling of venturing outside the only place you've ever known.

At first, I was frustrated by the lack of a run option, as many games like this would have one. However, I soon realized that this game didn't need one - this was a game to be taken slow, to be cherished for the time it asks. This is highlighted with the cliff with the view at the top of the village - you have the opportunity to stop and rest there every single chapter. This is a game to be savored.

Above all, the best part of the game is also the best part of World's Dawn: the characters and the dialogue between them are all perfect.

[h1]Intro[/h1]
In a world where a threat looms over the world, what happens to the NPCs? Take a journey on Lyric's life, a humble innkeeper in a small village with a great view. Her story might not be as triumphant as adventurers that are roaming around the world and saving it, but it doesn't mean that it's not special either. [b]A Story Beside[/b] attempts to take on an unconventional approach, allowing us to realize that there is something special in Lyric's daily life. The journey will span over the years, from her childhood to her death.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Multiple story branchings based on your choices
- An amazingly done voice dub full of emotion
- Soothing piano music that brings more of the story

- Replaying the game for other branches might take time due to the unskippable cutscenes and slow walking speed

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
Pyreside is just a small village that is connected by a long bridge and thick woods. Despite having to explore the same areas throughout the years, you will notice some differences from time to time. New trees will grow in the woods, bedrooms will change based on the people who sleep there - there is always something worthy to note. What amazes me the most is when the game sets in winter. There aren't any paths that look obvious at first, but you'll instinctively know where to go since you have traversed the same path several times. The lighting helps to make the scene look dreamy and heartwarming at the same time, and the use of the blurred image of the town as a background indoors does a good job to make the scene look more beautiful. All in all, I liked the aesthetic approaches that are used in the game.

[h3]Story[/h3]
Meet Lyric. She was born as a child of an innkeeper, in a small mountain village called Pyreside. The outside is dangerous with monsters roaming around, so she never ventures outside. If this is another game, she'll be a hero that saves the world, but this isn't it. She's no fighter, and never will be. She only knows how to serve people, wash blankets, and talk to other villagers just like any other innkeeper. The game tries to emphasize more on that feeling, expressing how blessed she is with her life.

Although the premise sounds boring, the execution isn't. Poetic words fill the whole narrative, sending a brief, subtle message about what was happening. The voice dub is also brilliant - it brings weight to the narrative with the emotions showing up in it. The relaxing piano music portrays the slow-paced world perfectly, and just like the voice dub, the tune fits well with the atmosphere: cheerful times are accompanied by a strong, cheerful tune, while darker times are portrayed with a lower, subtle tune. My spirit was always lifted whenever the piano sound shifts into a more cheerful one. The combinations of these aspects help to bring the story to a greater height, showing the proper emotions when the time is right.

[i]Wayward Prophet[/i] did an excellent job in creating a heartwarming story in [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/432010/Worlds_Dawn/]World's Dawn[/url][/b] ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198132503739/recommended/432010]my review[/url]), and [b]A Story Beside[/b] isn't any different. The story is a slow-paced one, full of heartwarming moments. You'll see how things and people change throughout the years: someone who looks grumpy all the time will eventually learn how to smile, characters being more mature as they grow up, things like that. What makes it more special is that the change doesn't feel forced at all. The main character will change her mindset as she talks to more people throughout the years, appreciates more what others did, and most importantly, cherishes the lives that matter to her the most. It's a sort of story that can make you feel emotional all the time.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
As a story-heavy game, there isn't much to say about the gameplay. The game is divided into 7 chapters, where seven years passed between each one except the last. Each chapter lasts for one or several in-game days, which translates to around an hour in real life. Since the game is set in a village, you'll have to explore the same areas all the time, talking to all villagers and the interactable objects that you can find in every chapter. This can be annoying sometimes, especially since the main character has a slow walking speed. Some events will also require you to pick up objects lying on the ground, which are easy to find due to their blinking color.

There is a QTE in the game, but the delay between each action is very long. You don't have to worry about not being fast enough to press the button. Besides, there is no penalty - you can always press the buttons until you succeed.

I'm amazed at the amount of story branching that the game has. The changes are minimal, but that's the charm of the game: it's up to you to shape the story. Your decision will change a lot of things, whether it's your life or others, for the better or worse. Although some choices will take effect right away, others are more subtle, showing their repercussions a few chapters after. It's what I liked about the game the most. You need to pay attention to everything that the game has to offer and think of the possibilities.

The visuals are charming and the music is pretty nice. If you like the idea of slowly building up resources to fight powerful kaiju, then check this game out when it's on sale.

However, despite no true flaws, I felt the pacing of the game to be too slow for my liking. The economy system feels like it makes things too gradual. When a kaiju is attacking your city, it seems odd to start building tanks and planes at that point. The military should be ready to go and not need to wait for individual dollars from the economy phase. I get that this is a usual trait of many strategy games, however, I feel like the money and unit deployment systems could have been streamlined a bit to make the game feel more exciting.

With that said, if you like slow-paced strategy games, then give this one a shot. The animations are all pretty nice and the gameplay is solid.

The visuals are charming and the music is pretty nice. If you like the idea of slowly building up resources to fight powerful kaiju, then check this game out when it's on sale.

However, despite no true flaws, I felt the pacing of the game to be too slow for my liking. The economy system feels like it makes things too gradual. When a kaiju is attacking your city, it seems odd to start building tanks and planes at that point. The military should be ready to go and not need to wait for individual dollars from the economy phase. I get that this is a usual trait of many strategy games, however, I feel like the money and unit deployment systems could have been streamlined a bit to make the game feel more exciting.

With that said, if you like slow-paced strategy games, then give this one a shot. The animations are all pretty nice and the gameplay is solid.

146,116022110,english,"First, I will say that there are several aspects about this game that I really do like.  The need to go quickly to find all of the cards required, versus not getting caught by the ""ghost"" does create a good amount of tension.  It reminds me of a lot of elements from the game The Horror of Salazar House, which I think the developers took some inspiration from, which is a good thing in my book.

The 3 different characters to choose from do add some element of strategy to the game, as based on their various traits, how you go about doing things first going in the house might differ.  It adds a little bit to the game's replay-ability, as you will probably need to play through the game several times just to both get an understanding of the game, and get familiarized with everything.

Also, I love the style and the sound in the game, as well as the cut-scenes, are very well done, and look very nice, setting up the atmosphere well.

That being said, a few areas where I think the game can be improved would be:

- Tweaking the ""ghost"" a bit, to be able to understand better where she is, in relation to your character, is needed.  While you can turn your character in-game to get some clue from the audio of the ghost as to where she might be, a lot of times, it just felt like she was either constantly near me, or very far away.  This makes the hiding element of the game feel a little unhelpful, as you can't easily determine when hiding, where the ghost while doing so.  Multiple times, I would hide, listen for any sound I could, only get out of my hiding spot just to have the ""ghost"" be right there still in the room.

Also while I think they did a good job on the audio, a little more variety in sounds the ghost makes would be nice, and give a bit more tension while playing.  After hearing the ghost do nothing but basically sing throughout my several playthroughs, it got a little old to hear, and brought down the scare factor just a bit.

- I'm not sure how much a person would play the game once they beat it.  Now to be fair, I haven't beaten the game yet, but as of right now, I don't see much else that would give you much reason to come back to it after you've finished it, other than maybe trying to beat it with a certain character, or to try and not have any characters fail at all, etc..  Overall though, for the price right now, I'm not sure it will give it's value back, playtime-wise, for a lot of people.  It feels more like a game that should be more like $4-5 tops at the moment.

- The different story items you can find throughout the house, should be in a place you can go back and look at them from the main menu.  I don't know if the characters' ""sweat level"" keeps going up while viewing these various story items in-game, but the way the game plays, I didn't ever really stop to pay too much attention to them, fearing I was needing to move quickly.  A little gallery in the main menu, maybe after completing the game, or just after finding each story item, would be nice for people to get a better idea of the background story, without needing to feel rushed to read each of these items during your in-game playthrough.

- Changing the set locations where key items you need to find, to instead be more randomized each game, would be nice.  Again, if the purpose of the game is to be more of a game that you play until you beat, thus being more of a limited but fun short game experience...then not randomizing the location of certain items, like a key, is fine.  

But again, the price point makes me feel that it should cost a little less than $7 if that's the case, as once you get the gist of the game, with a little practice, you should be able to get through it consistently I feel, without too much difficulty (but again, I haven't beaten the game yet so maybe there's more replayability to it that I haven't gotten to see yet?)

- Finally, and this is just my own personal small gripe...the x-ray specs you buy from the merchant, either don't seem to help much, or I just am not very attuned as to what I am supposed to look for, or see, while using them.  Occasionally, I'd see items through various searchable areas with them, but most of the time, I couldn't really tell when something searchable contained anything.  Even if I could, I couldn't make out what exactly that thing was.  Again, this could be just me, and maybe they aren't supposed to be too powerful, as that would possibly make things too easy, but I think the x-ray specs, and what they show to help save you time searching through everything, need a little bit of work to make them of any real help.

Overall, I am enjoying playing through the game, and have had fun, but I worry how much I'll be compelled to play it ever again after it's beaten.  The developers clearly did a great job with the visuals and sound, and you can see the love for making their game is there... I just worry that it may be priced too high right now, for the amount of gameplay you actually get, to warrant a purchase for most people.

I think this game is fantastic. The story and art style are awesome plus it has some great horror elements. I think it is for sure worth playing. I did have two issues with it though. The first is that it's kinda hard to tell where the ghost is and when you hide you can't hear at all if she has left or not. The other issue was a game breaking bug that kept happening in the upstairs bathroom. Every time the ghost came in while I was in there I would get stuck and unable to leave or do anything.

[h1] Review [/h1]
[b] Summary - [/b] Uninvited is about three kids who are trying to find 13 zombie cards from one of their brothers who hid them in this mysterious house. Little did the kids know, A dark presence lives in the home. The further you get into the house, the more you will uncover and learn the dark past of the home.

[b] Story - [/b] The Story in Uninvited is actually really interesting and engaging. You wander into this mysterious house and you learn the history of the occupants who lived here. It’s a pretty tragic story and is really well put together. It has a dark story and gives me some Monster House vibes which is also a plus. A really unique story and pretty refreshing for a horror indie game.

[b] Gameplay - [/b] The gameplay is pretty good. You have three playable characters with different traits that can make it easier or harder. You have only three lives to complete the game so if one of the playable characters die, you have to switch to one of the other characters. It’s a pretty cool mechanic on how they do it to be honest. You can buy some items to help you make it just a tad easier which is a cool mechanic as well, even though it kinda doesn’t make sense. I find it kinda silly that you have a deadly spirit in the house but hey, let me feed it some chocolate so it will leave me alone for a short while. Or use body spray to stop you from sweating so the ghost can't track you. It’s pretty comedic in a way, but I guess we can mark it off as unique. The hiding mechanic is pretty bad in my opinion. You have no idea if the ghost is nearby or not as you can only hear your heartbeat. Now if the ghost is right up your rear end before entering the closet, you can hear it knock and breathe so once you only hear your heartbeat, you are free to get out of the closet. I’m not a fan of how they did the hiding mechanic. Like if the ghost saw you enter the closet, you would think it would just open it and grab you. But hey, only if you have a high sweat meter you have a risk of that happening. Probably my only complaint about this game.

[b] Graphics - [/b] I love the graphics for this game. It's a very unique 2.5D kinda style. It truly gives you this Indie horror vibe to it and looks pretty scary. The lighting from your light source is good. The image is sharp and easy to see the environment. Honestly the art style drew me in to buying this and was not disappointed at all.

The 3 different characters to choose from do add some element of strategy to the game, as based on their various traits, how you go about doing things first going in the house might differ.  It adds a little bit to the game's replay-ability, as you will probably need to play through the game several times just to both get an understanding of the game, and get familiarized with everything.

Also, I love the style and the sound in the game, as well as the cut-scenes, are very well done, and look very nice, setting up the atmosphere well.

That being said, a few areas where I think the game can be improved would be:

- Tweaking the ""ghost"" a bit, to be able to understand better where she is, in relation to your character, is needed.  While you can turn your character in-game to get some clue from the audio of the ghost as to where she might be, a lot of times, it just felt like she was either constantly near me, or very far away.  This makes the hiding element of the game feel a little unhelpful, as you can't easily determine when hiding, where the ghost while doing so.  Multiple times, I would hide, listen for any sound I could, only get out of my hiding spot just to have the ""ghost"" be right there still in the room.

Also while I think they did a good job on the audio, a little more variety in sounds the ghost makes would be nice, and give a bit more tension while playing.  After hearing the ghost do nothing but basically sing throughout my several playthroughs, it got a little old to hear, and brought down the scare factor just a bit.

- I'm not sure how much a person would play the game once they beat it.  Now to be fair, I haven't beaten the game yet, but as of right now, I don't see much else that would give you much reason to come back to it after you've finished it, other than maybe trying to beat it with a certain character, or to try and not have any characters fail at all, etc..  Overall though, for the price right now, I'm not sure it will give it's value back, playtime-wise, for a lot of people.  It feels more like a game that should be more like $4-5 tops at the moment.

- The different story items you can find throughout the house, should be in a place you can go back and look at them from the main menu.  I don't know if the characters' ""sweat level"" keeps going up while viewing these various story items in-game, but the way the game plays, I didn't ever really stop to pay too much attention to them, fearing I was needing to move quickly.  A little gallery in the main menu, maybe after completing the game, or just after finding each story item, would be nice for people to get a better idea of the background story, without needing to feel rushed to read each of these items during your in-game playthrough.

- Changing the set locations where key items you need to find, to instead be more randomized each game, would be nice.  Again, if the purpose of the game is to be more of a game that you play until you beat, thus being more of a limited but fun short game experience...then not randomizing the location of certain items, like a key, is fine.  

But again, the price point makes me feel that it should cost a little less than $7 if that's the case, as once you get the gist of the game, with a little practice, you should be able to get through it consistently I feel, without too much difficulty (but again, I haven't beaten the game yet so maybe there's more replayability to it that I haven't gotten to see yet?)

- Finally, and this is just my own personal small gripe...the x-ray specs you buy from the merchant, either don't seem to help much, or I just am not very attuned as to what I am supposed to look for, or see, while using them.  Occasionally, I'd see items through various searchable areas with them, but most of the time, I couldn't really tell when something searchable contained anything.  Even if I could, I couldn't make out what exactly that thing was.  Again, this could be just me, and maybe they aren't supposed to be too powerful, as that would possibly make things too easy, but I think the x-ray specs, and what they show to help save you time searching through everything, need a little bit of work to make them of any real help.

Overall, I am enjoying playing through the game, and have had fun, but I worry how much I'll be compelled to play it ever again after it's beaten.  The developers clearly did a great job with the visuals and sound, and you can see the love for making their game is there... I just worry that it may be priced too high right now, for the amount of gameplay you actually get, to warrant a purchase for most people.

I think this game is fantastic. The story and art style are awesome plus it has some great horror elements. I think it is for sure worth playing. I did have two issues with it though. The first is that it's kinda hard to tell where the ghost is and when you hide you can't hear at all if she has left or not. The other issue was a game breaking bug that kept happening in the upstairs bathroom. Every time the ghost came in while I was in there I would get stuck and unable to leave or do anything.

[h1] Review [/h1]
[b] Summary - [/b] Uninvited is about three kids who are trying to find 13 zombie cards from one of their brothers who hid them in this mysterious house. Little did the kids know, A dark presence lives in the home. The further you get into the house, the more you will uncover and learn the dark past of the home.

[b] Story - [/b] The Story in Uninvited is actually really interesting and engaging. You wander into this mysterious house and you learn the history of the occupants who lived here. It’s a pretty tragic story and is really well put together. It has a dark story and gives me some Monster House vibes which is also a plus. A really unique story and pretty refreshing for a horror indie game.

[b] Gameplay - [/b] The gameplay is pretty good. You have three playable characters with different traits that can make it easier or harder. You have only three lives to complete the game so if one of the playable characters die, you have to switch to one of the other characters. It’s a pretty cool mechanic on how they do it to be honest. You can buy some items to help you make it just a tad easier which is a cool mechanic as well, even though it kinda doesn’t make sense. I find it kinda silly that you have a deadly spirit in the house but hey, let me feed it some chocolate so it will leave me alone for a short while. Or use body spray to stop you from sweating so the ghost can't track you. It’s pretty comedic in a way, but I guess we can mark it off as unique. The hiding mechanic is pretty bad in my opinion. You have no idea if the ghost is nearby or not as you can only hear your heartbeat. Now if the ghost is right up your rear end before entering the closet, you can hear it knock and breathe so once you only hear your heartbeat, you are free to get out of the closet. I’m not a fan of how they did the hiding mechanic. Like if the ghost saw you enter the closet, you would think it would just open it and grab you. But hey, only if you have a high sweat meter you have a risk of that happening. Probably my only complaint about this game.

[b] Graphics - [/b] I love the graphics for this game. It's a very unique 2.5D kinda style. It truly gives you this Indie horror vibe to it and looks pretty scary. The lighting from your light source is good. The image is sharp and easy to see the environment. Honestly the art style drew me in to buying this and was not disappointed at all.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2812564745

	Whether by fate or chance, my huge family tree includes an impressive quantity of Lady Susies. Somehow, they always manage to progress our multi-generational quest more than any other nameholder. You see, everyone in our family knows that they’re headed for a violent, early end - and they do it anyway. Our legacy is blood - although the ever-shifting maze repopulates with every death we incur, we press on, discovering new areas and killing the boss in each of them. Our legacy is gold, too, allowing our offspring to develop new wings to our castle, buy and upgrade gear and runes before they, in turn, hop towards the dungeon’s entrance for one last descent…
	Rogue Legacy 2 is the sequel to Cellar Door Games’ 2013 roguelike indie gem, visually upgraded while maintaining the specific appeal of the original: a 2D romp in which you have to make situational use of your dashes, double jumps, spin kicks and class abilities until you master the knowledge and reflexes required to clear areas and finish the game.
 
	The controls are tight and responsive - and you’ll be happy that is the case, as you’ll have plenty of opportunities to practice your platforming skills. Aside from the usual dodging and dancing around projectiles, most of the game’s runes are locked behind challenges requiring you to achieve certain feats in order to loot chests that melt if you fail. I highly recommend using a controller for Rogue Legacy 2, as the alternative use of abilities makes great use of the triggers while the aiming-oriented classes feel natural to control using two joysticks, giving off strong run-and-gun vibes when playing the Gunslinger, specifically.
Speaking of classes, you’ll have plenty of styles to explore: your characters can have one of fifteen different “professions” (with unlockable alternates you can unlock with souls, a currency that drops from bosses). Although they all fall under three major categories (melee, ranged or caster) there are significant playstyle differences between them: the Chef, for example, can return most projectiles in a volley with his pan and his self-healing class ability ensures a lot more resilience while exploring - as opposed to the Boxer, for example, who despite also being a melee warrior has a much more rushdown-oriented playstyle, increasing his damage as he achieves a higher combo counter. 
   

[h1]A World of Pain[/h1]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2812564349

The underground dungeon you have to explore is randomized with every death, but retains a general sprawl of six different areas, each with their own boss and thematic enemies. Traps, resolve management, “fatal” artifacts, spikes, enemies will kill you over and over again, but there’s a clear sense of progress and a drive to not repeat mistakes that keeps you going forward. There’s enough mechanical depth and variety to keep you going for a lot longer than the thin-paper plot and scarce worldbuilding. The art direction is consistent and makes great use of tones to convey mood in every area: from the horizontal, side-scrolling sprints through Axis Mundi (the second area) to the tight vertical platforming of the Sun Tower, there’s a lot of memorable moments empowered by the craft and sweat of the artists who conceived this world.
	By the time you’ve cleared your first playthrough, the game will seem fairly easy - whether because you have quick reflexes and a good grasp on how to avoid damage, or because you’ve dumped literal tonnes of gold, ore and aether into your castle wings, runes and gear. No matter - in true roguelike fashion, New Game+ includes a plethora of handicaps you can activate, a Prime mode for every boss (an improved version of them), which you have to finish numerous times in order to reach the game’s “true” ending, and no matter how much you upgrade at one point you’ll simply have to learn the actual dance.

	https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2812564527

	An aspect that often defines a roguelike’s life expectancy is how grind-oriented it is, and Rogue Legacy lets you take a pretty relaxed approach to it. There are bottlenecks, of course, but most of them are simply skillchecks. Sure, you can spend an hour or two doing gold runs and filling up your coffers before you engage the same boss with more damage, mana and a larger health pool, but you’ll probably be faster just trying out the bossfight until you can do it perfectly. I never felt like I was being held back by raw values as much as I was incorrectly using the screen space and abilities to avoid incoming damage, which is what boss fights are all about. In that regard, you can avoid grinding altogether if you’re quick and fast learning enough.
	The colorful, cartoonish graphics and genre-savvy music and sounds are exactly as shown on the cover - a modern, less pixelated facelift applied to the style and vibe of the original title. The design is clear and projectile types are often color-coded, while enemy types directly reference the designs of skeletons and floating mages I oddly remember from playing the first game almost eight years ago. 
	Rogue Legacy 2’s strength is its gameplay. It’s fun whether tackled in small or big sessions and while its sense of novelty will wear out quickly, you’ll find yourself playing long after that, fueled by its engaging platforming elements and fast-paced combat. It’s admirable how balanced and fine-tuned the game is - almost as if it knows when to spike up the difficulty in order to motivate you - and it allows a soft sliding difficult scale through its House Rules feature, a customizable difficulty panel ensuring that even newcomers to the genre can see the adventure through.

243,116714556,english,"Rogue Legacy 2 is an excellent follow-on from the first. Some of minor annoyances from the original have been dealt with and the game caters to a broad spectrum of play styles and ability levels.

The number of areas has increased from 4 to 6 and the areas feel unique, rather than reskins of the same template. One zone in particular has a lot of verticality which is great fun for those into platformers. There are also exploratory side missions that rewards you with additional lore, bonus challenges, and damage buffs against bosses. 

The classes in the original were more-or-less the same, just with different stats, but that's not the case now. Each class plays completely differently. I really enjoyed the boxer who has a combo meter and can float in the air while their rapid punches are making contact with the enemy! Additionally, there is an ability fairly early in the game which can lock a class to one of your heirs, so if there's a particular class you really enjoy, then you can keep using them. Although bear in mind that there are rewards for using a variety of classes in the form of stat bonuses.

You will always be in a situation where you can progress. In the original, I sometimes found myself having a series of bad runs and never having the money to upgrade abilities. That's no longer the case now as there is a magic safe that will store a small proportion of your money before you start a new run. So even if you have a series of bad runs, you will eventually have enough money to upgrade something.

You can progress through the NG+ at your own pace. I won't give away too much about NG+, but if you feel like you have bitten off more than you can chew, you can dial it back at any time. 

A few minor things about the game:
-I miss the circus minigames from the original. I'm guessing they would have been a bit of an atmosphere killer in this, but it would have been nice to have an alternative. I suppose some of the charm chest rooms were similar, but I enjoyed the lighthearted respite in the original!
-I liked the miniboss trap room in the original (with the Doomvas) and I was kinda hoping there would be more of that kind of stuff in this one.

And one tiny annoyance:
-The UI in the Scars of Erebus is a bit awkward. It would be nice for the cursor to remember which challenge you were on (for when you're retrying the same challenge) and it would be nice if there was an easier way to check individual class scores for each challenge rather than having to press 'Y/Triangle' over each scar. (E.g. Have a table that has the classes as rows, scars as columns, with all the scores in the cells, and totals at the end. This is so you can quickly check which classes/challenges have been neglected).

Aside from that, a solid 9/10 for me! Thanks guys, well worth the wait :)

244,116615938,english,"Amazing game. Perfect blend of Roguelite mechanics, platforming, progression and puns.

Gameplay Loop:

1) Select from a list of 3 characters. Each characters usually have a bonus or a negative trait (which give a gold bonus) attached to them.
2) Get ready for your adventure the usual way (shopping, equipping runes, talking to NPCs, playing mini games)
3) Explore the castle visitng various stages. This allows you to progress the storyline, get various types of currency, get artficat, etc
4) Did you die? Did you killed the last boss? If so, go back to 1. 

Why I whole heartily recommend this game:
- The difficulty is great. I felt the game was a perfect blend of frustrating and fun. If you don't like game where you are award for pattern recognition then this game might not be for you. Plus in the NG+ mode you get a Hade-like select the buffs the enemy get. 
- The grinding isn't there. you might hear about the grinding in this game and I'm here to tell you it isn't true. If you're good then you don't need to grind but if you're not so good (like me!) or just like experimenting then you get rewarded with your failures. I never felt grinding was a means to an end.
- Movement powers. The dashes, air dashes, air stomp and double jumping(+) feels really good. 
- The hit box in this game is well done. It's a weird thing to mention but the hit box seems to be perfect. There was never a time that I thought I got hit when I shouldn't. This isn't a big thing but you'll never know how much you miss it until you play a game with a bad hit box.
- Progression system. So much stuff to unlock and explore. Even when you die, you feel like you got something for it. 

100% achievement takes around 80 hours? Probably less if you're good at this type of game. 
Honestly I wasn't trying for achievement in this game I was having such a good time. It sorta of just happened.

You're still picking a new heir with different quirks for each run, still going trough a randomly-assembled dungeon collecting cash, and still spending that cash on permament upgrades in between rounds. Your goal is still to defeat each of the bosses one at a time, until you unlock the final one and move on to New Game+. The nitty-gritty in between, however, is where the game was expanded substantially.

There is a bigger emphasis on movement abilities, which you will unlock in the course of runs, metroidvania-style. Each class now has its own unique weapon and playstyle, expressed in a far deeper stat system. A new relic system adds lots of wacky twists and modifiers to each individual run, which you will need to experiment with to prepare for the far more complex bossfights. All done in much better visuals and sound.

But the usual trappings of Roguelite still apply - there will be instances of deep frustration with the RNG, as well as times where you feel like you're just spinning your wheels on the gold grind. Many a run will end prematurely simply because you decided to try a new thing, and screwed yourself over. And then of course you will get that one ""god run"" that feels ecstatic.

249,116648102,english,"I wish I could rate this just okay or so-so. Rogue Legacy 2 certainly has more than the original Rogue Legacy, but it's not necessarily more GOOD. The more I play it, the more I am led to believe that the developers were never entirely sure what lightning in a bottle they captured that made the first installment so successful, and as a result have simply dialed up everything to 11 hoping that something will stick. There's more classes, weapons, skills, enemies, etc., but there's ten times the amount of garbage you will have to deal with experiencing it.

The grind is obviously part of the experience of this game, and is put front-and-center with the iterative upgrades you buy after each run attempt, but feels orders of magnitude worse than the previous title. The risk-reward proposition in this game is abysmal. The game will highly discourage you from taking any risks and instead you will quickly find that you will amass much more treasure and experience by steamrolling lower-difficulty areas over and over rather than attempting somewhere more challenging, where you will eventually be killed in two or three hits. Damage can come from anywhere, and projectiles often move faster than you can react, with projectiles or traps coming from offscreen to whittle a third of your health down after you've already scoped out your plan for things on the screen. The end result is often expending your mechanical resources of an extra jump or dash to cleanly eliminate what is on screen, but now that you air in midair and have those mechanics disabled until you touch down, you can easily be tagged by new things that have entered the screen after executing your plan. Normally having to react to things is such a standard part of video games that it seems almost ridiculous to mention something like this at all, but it will happen to you SO MUCH in RL2 that it bears mention. You WILL be tagged by things coming from offscreen, you WILL be hit by attacks that make no sense, and you WILL die to BS, over and over again. To some people, this grind can be exciting, as it becomes more akin to gambling, hoping to get lucky and not spin bankrupt rather than outplaying the enemies, but to me I find it tedious.

Enemy telegraphs in this game are abysmal, and I don't mean in the ""enemy makes a windup motion and then you react"" sense. I mean, an enemy will clearly show that they are executing some sort of attack, but instead of it being something you can safely react to or learn from, it will suddenly be a fast-moving projectile that will shoot through walls to hit you. Why does an enemy who only appears to have a melee weapon have an attack like this? Why do some projectiles go through walls and others don't? There's dozens of overengineered mechanics in this game ranging from several kinds of weights and how they affect what you can pick up without ruining your max health, down to several currencies, bonuses, debuffs, and all these things which should really just be taking a backseat to the hack and slash mechanics. I doubt many players care that their new armor gives them plus seventeen smeerps instead of fifteen, when the areas you want to explore will still kill you in three hits. The upgrades are so incrementally tiny, it feels like garbage even sinking points into any of them at all.

There's simply so much crammed into this game that don't strictly make it better that bothers me. There's lore books shoehorned in in the most hamfisted manner, sidequests which are vague enough that even when you know exactly what a riddle is referring to, you will still fail because you were standing two inches too far away to trigger a secret door. Just google this stuff, it's legitimately not worth trying to solve the riddles, especially since it just leads to more ways to obtain more nonsense currencies that let you buy more tiny upgrades, seriously, sometimes simplicity is better.

Multiple runs in this game are tiring and overtly repetitive, something that is not good for a roguelite or any game that has ""rogue"" so brazenly spotlit in the title. I want to experience all this game has to offer but this gameplay loop is trying my patience and you can get about triple the dopamine per run in many other similar roguelites. RL2 isn't bad, it's not great, and it really is just about as okay as RL1, with a more convoluted path to the golden gameplay loop that seems to take the backseat.

However if youre experienced in these sorts of games you might find a lot of smaller things that will hinder your enjoyment.



MILD GAMEPLAY SPOILERS AHEAD

This isn't really a ""not recommended"" but as steam doesnt have a mid option, this is what im going with.

this one hurts, genuinely. Rogue Legacy 1 is a game i still hold dear to my heart as it was the first game that i consciously played as an ""Indie Game"" and got me started to look deeper into smaller games. (i think it also was my first rogue-like, but not 100% if i didnt play BoI first)

So let me start this out by saying this: If you're looking for a foundationally solid rogue-lite experience with great art and some quirks, this game is not a bad choice by any means, and you can certainly have fun with it.

However, while I replayed RL1 a bunch of times, including beating the game in just a couple generations and going into NG+[high number i dont remember] , at some point i decided to just get through the rest of the game and be done with it, and now that im done, i have no desire to ever open it up again and very mixed feelings if i actually enjoyed these 18 hours.

[b]1) Professional Polishers[/b]

So where are the issues? Honestly, Its hard to pin down but there are a lot of smaller things that add up. Like already said, the graphics are great, the foundation is solid, the controls are responsive, the basic combat is polished...

...but here we come to our first and main type of issue: Everythings just a little too polished. I firmly believe that rogue-likes are a genre that shouldnt be polished too much. It requires unbalanced things, it requires quirky moments, it requires useless but fun roads to go down. Binding of Isaac is maybe the most unbalanced rogue-like ever and maybe the greatest, so that should tell you somethings. The nature of it is that it builds on randomness and variety.

Heres an example of what i mean: RL1 had traits that made the game way harder (think vertigo) for no compensation whatsoever. Does that mean vertigo was a bad addition to the game? I would argue no, i still picked a vertigo character occasionally for funsies. RL2 meanwhile introduces welfare, meaning you get a percentage money bonus depending on how bad a trait is. No more funsies, now thats a balanced tradeoff. (it also feels like theres way less traits, the amount of times ive looked at my options and all 3 had no traits was baffling to me)

This extends to other parts of the game as well. Another Example: You have a relic system thats expanded way beyond what RL1 had just so you can give the player 10% bonus damage in certain situations. Also you can only have so many relics before your HP takes a hit, how much is correlated to your equipment. Why have it be this advanced and then barely affect the gameplay? Except for 1-2 runs the relics felt absolutely pointless.

Locking class, rerolling and more options so you can always have pretty much the exact character you want! sounds great right? until you realize it ruins the variety of the game while being the theoretical best play.

[b]2) Metroidvania?[/b]

The game tries to go into the metroidvania direction but leaves very little room for exploration early on. you get an heirloom, you unlock one new area, where you get an heirloom that unlocks the next area... The game even straight up tells you ""this is area number X"".

It feels like its being done just for the buzzword and less for its actual contribution to the gameplay. And its made worse by...

[b]3) Grinddddddd [/b]

Now i wanna reiterate that while i make it sound like these are massive fuckups each and every one, none of them are by themselves. If this game for example only had issues with too balanced relics and traits, it would still be a great game. And similarly to the next point: There are definitely grindier rogue-likes out there. However, unless you bang your head against a wall like I did in the end, you'll likely still have to grind. And its just not rewarding. Why exactly is hard to pin down, but i think it comes from the overwhelming amount of things to invest in vs. what you can actually manage in a NG and the in comparison to that fairly quick price increase. Also going back to polish, i noticed in the beginning that with the same money bonus i always ended up with pretty much the exact same amount of money after clearing the citadel out +-100. Which sounds brilliant on paper, but makes the grind even less exciting.

I beat RL1 in just a couple generations without too much issue. This here feels impossible (im sure it isnt actually). It makes the grinding feel mandatory, while in RL1 it felt like an option to make it a bit easier.

[b]4) Variety until there isnt [/b]

Riddle me this: In a sequel, whos main difference is that different classes now have different weapons that work completely differently, why have XP per class? That just points towards maining 1-2 classes and ignoring the rest. Again, the bonus you get from XP is fairly miniscule, like everything here its a minor point, but it pushes you in the imho wrong direction.

Another issue personally is that due to enemies tendency to run into you, classes that didnt allow moving while attacking/stunned you for a second when attacking felt really static and unfun in comparison, which again made me wanna limit myself to just a few classes. For a while i forced myself to pick the other ones regularly but eventually i gave up on that towards the end.

[b]5) combat [/b]

so you have like 4 ways to counter projectiles in a somtimes bullet hell-like game where positioning matters and you have to keep track of mana, skill cooldown, etc.. It gets overwhelming sometimes. Which would be fine in most games but again, it a rogue-lite, a genre which is about just playing until it works, its imho the wrong decision to complicate things so much.

[b]6) and lots of lots of other small things [/b]

so i dont write an essay heres a rundown of more smaller things that bothered me:

[list]
[*] I dont have anything to base it on but it felt like there were just as many different enemies and rooms in RL2 as there were in RL1 while RL2 is a bigger game
[*] half the bosses are quite neat, half arent
[*] i hunted for fairy chests and spent a bunch on being able to find more runes and still struggled to fill out the rune weight i could carry with runes i wanted
[*] why are iron and blood currencies a thing? 
[*] Some of the dialogue is long winded and tries too hard to be funny imo
[*] heirlooms apparently have a personality each just so they can speak... 2 sentences?
[*] wtf is the difficulty spike from area 4 to 5
[*] some of the side content like the is unsatisfying and just not that fun
[*] ...
[/list]

i could go on but i leave it here. I hope you get the point. None of these points would be enough. Theyre all fairly miniscule but just add up.

255,117371145,english,"So, let me start off by saying that I wanted to finish the game twice before giving this review, just to make sure its not just my initial excitement talking. What I want to say is that this game has been designed to be completed. Its not designed to frustrate or waste your time. The reason that I say this is that for every mechanic that makes this title roguelike, there is an unlock you can purchase by playing the game, and making the experience less random and more focused on progressing.

Now to continue I will try to explain what I mean by ""designed to be completed and not waste your time"" to the best of my ability, with the mention that the review contains spoilers, and you can always youtube this and get a tutorial or just see general gameplay.

The mechanics of the game are as follows: every run you get a random map and 3 random heroes to choose from (with your options increasing as you unlock more classes. You can obtain 4 types of resources: gold, blood, ore and soul. At the start of each run (following your death) you have to give your gold away (or portion of it) but you keep all blood, ore and soul and everything you unlocked, including passive experience gains, gear, runes, etc.

Now, as you progress, you unlock mechanics to counteract the randomness of the game, such as: 
- very close to the start of the game you unlock the ""Arhitect"" which will lock the world in place as many runs as you want, at an increasingly tax on your gold gains. I use this a lot to focus on a specific boss, because the valuable resources the boss drops are not affected by the Arhitect penalty, just the gold gain. 
- teleporter at the start of each biome unlocked permanently to allow you to focus on a specific biome. I try to unlock the Axis Mundi permanent teleporter due to the passive 20% gold gain and somewhat easy map.
- the ability to start various challenges as many times as you want which in turn reward the Soul resources. With the Soul resource you unlock permanent option to lock any class you want in place with any secondary ability you choose, and many other useful things, such as the ability to toggle between weapons for most classes, or be able to drop higher tiers of gears and runes, and many more 
- 6 most recent backup saves.  I use this if I get really good modifiers on a specific character, like +50% weapon damage, and I try to progress in a boss fight.


In the end of this review I want to mention that for me, for my style of play, I felt respected as a player and my time valued.
I usually stay away from wasting my time with roguelikes and roguelites because I feel most of them are designed to frustrate and create a fake ""skill barrier"" which is actually empty content and lack of ideas wrapped under a toxic ""be pro or get out"" banner.

I guess if any game were to do it, it'd be Rogue Legacy's sequel. If you liked the first game, buy this right now. It's nothing but improvements over the original. Graphically, it looks stunning, it's absolutely addicting, controls amazingly, and the post game content is very fun too. I'm on NG+2 right now and it's really fun to blitz through the game while setting new gold records every other run.

All of the new features are extremely well implemented. Spin kicking is such an amazing mechanic, and it honestly makes me never wanna go back to the first game. If you've played Isaac- you know how Binding of Isaac: Rebirth basically made the original Flash Isaac redundant? Yeah, we've got another case of that. Seriously, what an improvement over the original.

It's easily a contender for one my favorite Roguelikes, and trust me, I play a [i]lot[/i] of Roguelikes. It's got everything you'd want from a sequel, and even if you haven't played the original, what you've got here is an extremely well made Roguelike platformer. 

The only bad thing I have to say about it is that I think the writing is a little eh. Too many pizza jokes. Plus the story doesn't make sense unless you literally read the lore bible the game slowly dumps on you as you play.

But, yeah! Worth the full price. Early access did this game wonders, like holy hell. I was not expecting it to be this good!

292,116701078,english,"Overall, I'm really enjoying this game. I would give it a solid 8/10 and I'll probably put another couple dozen hours into it. The platforming feels great, the combat is snappy, and each new biome has a nice hook to keep things interesting. And there's definitely a lot of content if you're looking for a good grind.

However, I will say that enjoying this game requires resetting some expectations - although it's structurally very similar to a lot of roguelikes out there, it has a very different ""feel."" Most importantly, it's not really a build-focused game, even though it looks like it should be one. You might occasionally get a perk or relic that matches up really well with something else, but there's nowhere near the depth you would find in something like Dead Cells or Risk of Rain. It's much more about the classes, which is totally fine for me because there are so many of them and they all have nice differences in how they play. 

Secondly, it's a lot more like a side-scrolling ARPG (except for the build crafting, like I said) than a traditional Metroidvania platformer. Individual enemies have very basic attacks and patterns; it's less about engaging with any particular enemy and reacting to their actions, and more about managing larger groups and using abilities in fairly well-defined cycles. Again, I had no problem with this, but you're going to be disappointed if you want something more Dark Souls or Dead Cells (parrying, blocking, rolling, etc).

Finally, the actual ""gimmick"" of the game, the ancestor system, is really not as important as you might think. 90% of a run will be determined by the class you pick, while the genetic traits are usually pretty minor. I almost wish some of the other mechanics had been eliminated and repurposed as additional genetic traits, because right now the game feels a little light in that area - which is weird, because it's sorta the whole point of the game!

But don't let these things scare you off - it's still a really fun game that has a ton of polish and a ton of content.

	Whether by fate or chance, my huge family tree includes an impressive quantity of Lady Susies. Somehow, they always manage to progress our multi-generational quest more than any other nameholder. You see, everyone in our family knows that they’re headed for a violent, early end - and they do it anyway. Our legacy is blood - although the ever-shifting maze repopulates with every death we incur, we press on, discovering new areas and killing the boss in each of them. Our legacy is gold, too, allowing our offspring to develop new wings to our castle, buy and upgrade gear and runes before they, in turn, hop towards the dungeon’s entrance for one last descent…
	Rogue Legacy 2 is the sequel to Cellar Door Games’ 2013 roguelike indie gem, visually upgraded while maintaining the specific appeal of the original: a 2D romp in which you have to make situational use of your dashes, double jumps, spin kicks and class abilities until you master the knowledge and reflexes required to clear areas and finish the game.
 
	The controls are tight and responsive - and you’ll be happy that is the case, as you’ll have plenty of opportunities to practice your platforming skills. Aside from the usual dodging and dancing around projectiles, most of the game’s runes are locked behind challenges requiring you to achieve certain feats in order to loot chests that melt if you fail. I highly recommend using a controller for Rogue Legacy 2, as the alternative use of abilities makes great use of the triggers while the aiming-oriented classes feel natural to control using two joysticks, giving off strong run-and-gun vibes when playing the Gunslinger, specifically.
Speaking of classes, you’ll have plenty of styles to explore: your characters can have one of fifteen different “professions” (with unlockable alternates you can unlock with souls, a currency that drops from bosses). Although they all fall under three major categories (melee, ranged or caster) there are significant playstyle differences between them: the Chef, for example, can return most projectiles in a volley with his pan and his self-healing class ability ensures a lot more resilience while exploring - as opposed to the Boxer, for example, who despite also being a melee warrior has a much more rushdown-oriented playstyle, increasing his damage as he achieves a higher combo counter.

The underground dungeon you have to explore is randomized with every death, but retains a general sprawl of six different areas, each with their own boss and thematic enemies. Traps, resolve management, “fatal” artifacts, spikes, enemies will kill you over and over again, but there’s a clear sense of progress and a drive to not repeat mistakes that keeps you going forward. There’s enough mechanical depth and variety to keep you going for a lot longer than the thin-paper plot and scarce worldbuilding. The art direction is consistent and makes great use of tones to convey mood in every area: from the horizontal, side-scrolling sprints through Axis Mundi (the second area) to the tight vertical platforming of the Sun Tower, there’s a lot of memorable moments empowered by the craft and sweat of the artists who conceived this world.
	By the time you’ve cleared your first playthrough, the game will seem fairly easy - whether because you have quick reflexes and a good grasp on how to avoid damage, or because you’ve dumped literal tonnes of gold, ore and aether into your castle wings, runes and gear. No matter - in true roguelike fashion, New Game+ includes a plethora of handicaps you can activate, a Prime mode for every boss (an improved version of them), which you have to finish numerous times in order to reach the game’s “true” ending, and no matter how much you upgrade at one point you’ll simply have to learn the actual dance.

	An aspect that often defines a roguelike’s life expectancy is how grind-oriented it is, and Rogue Legacy lets you take a pretty relaxed approach to it. There are bottlenecks, of course, but most of them are simply skillchecks. Sure, you can spend an hour or two doing gold runs and filling up your coffers before you engage the same boss with more damage, mana and a larger health pool, but you’ll probably be faster just trying out the bossfight until you can do it perfectly. I never felt like I was being held back by raw values as much as I was incorrectly using the screen space and abilities to avoid incoming damage, which is what boss fights are all about. In that regard, you can avoid grinding altogether if you’re quick and fast learning enough.
	The colorful, cartoonish graphics and genre-savvy music and sounds are exactly as shown on the cover - a modern, less pixelated facelift applied to the style and vibe of the original title. The design is clear and projectile types are often color-coded, while enemy types directly reference the designs of skeletons and floating mages I oddly remember from playing the first game almost eight years ago. 
	Rogue Legacy 2’s strength is its gameplay. It’s fun whether tackled in small or big sessions and while its sense of novelty will wear out quickly, you’ll find yourself playing long after that, fueled by its engaging platforming elements and fast-paced combat. It’s admirable how balanced and fine-tuned the game is - almost as if it knows when to spike up the difficulty in order to motivate you - and it allows a soft sliding difficult scale through its House Rules feature, a customizable difficulty panel ensuring that even newcomers to the genre can see the adventure through.

302,116714556,english,"Rogue Legacy 2 is an excellent follow-on from the first. Some of minor annoyances from the original have been dealt with and the game caters to a broad spectrum of play styles and ability levels.

The number of areas has increased from 4 to 6 and the areas feel unique, rather than reskins of the same template. One zone in particular has a lot of verticality which is great fun for those into platformers. There are also exploratory side missions that rewards you with additional lore, bonus challenges, and damage buffs against bosses. 

The classes in the original were more-or-less the same, just with different stats, but that's not the case now. Each class plays completely differently. I really enjoyed the boxer who has a combo meter and can float in the air while their rapid punches are making contact with the enemy! Additionally, there is an ability fairly early in the game which can lock a class to one of your heirs, so if there's a particular class you really enjoy, then you can keep using them. Although bear in mind that there are rewards for using a variety of classes in the form of stat bonuses.

You will always be in a situation where you can progress. In the original, I sometimes found myself having a series of bad runs and never having the money to upgrade abilities. That's no longer the case now as there is a magic safe that will store a small proportion of your money before you start a new run. So even if you have a series of bad runs, you will eventually have enough money to upgrade something.

You can progress through the NG+ at your own pace. I won't give away too much about NG+, but if you feel like you have bitten off more than you can chew, you can dial it back at any time. 

A few minor things about the game:
-I miss the circus minigames from the original. I'm guessing they would have been a bit of an atmosphere killer in this, but it would have been nice to have an alternative. I suppose some of the charm chest rooms were similar, but I enjoyed the lighthearted respite in the original!
-I liked the miniboss trap room in the original (with the Doomvas) and I was kinda hoping there would be more of that kind of stuff in this one.

And one tiny annoyance:
-The UI in the Scars of Erebus is a bit awkward. It would be nice for the cursor to remember which challenge you were on (for when you're retrying the same challenge) and it would be nice if there was an easier way to check individual class scores for each challenge rather than having to press 'Y/Triangle' over each scar. (E.g. Have a table that has the classes as rows, scars as columns, with all the scores in the cells, and totals at the end. This is so you can quickly check which classes/challenges have been neglected).

Aside from that, a solid 9/10 for me! Thanks guys, well worth the wait :)

303,116615938,english,"Amazing game. Perfect blend of Roguelite mechanics, platforming, progression and puns.

Gameplay Loop:

1) Select from a list of 3 characters. Each characters usually have a bonus or a negative trait (which give a gold bonus) attached to them.
2) Get ready for your adventure the usual way (shopping, equipping runes, talking to NPCs, playing mini games)
3) Explore the castle visitng various stages. This allows you to progress the storyline, get various types of currency, get artficat, etc
4) Did you die? Did you killed the last boss? If so, go back to 1. 

Why I whole heartily recommend this game:
- The difficulty is great. I felt the game was a perfect blend of frustrating and fun. If you don't like game where you are award for pattern recognition then this game might not be for you. Plus in the NG+ mode you get a Hade-like select the buffs the enemy get. 
- The grinding isn't there. you might hear about the grinding in this game and I'm here to tell you it isn't true. If you're good then you don't need to grind but if you're not so good (like me!) or just like experimenting then you get rewarded with your failures. I never felt grinding was a means to an end.
- Movement powers. The dashes, air dashes, air stomp and double jumping(+) feels really good. 
- The hit box in this game is well done. It's a weird thing to mention but the hit box seems to be perfect. There was never a time that I thought I got hit when I shouldn't. This isn't a big thing but you'll never know how much you miss it until you play a game with a bad hit box.
- Progression system. So much stuff to unlock and explore. Even when you die, you feel like you got something for it. 

100% achievement takes around 80 hours? Probably less if you're good at this type of game. 
Honestly I wasn't trying for achievement in this game I was having such a good time. It sorta of just happened.

You're still picking a new heir with different quirks for each run, still going trough a randomly-assembled dungeon collecting cash, and still spending that cash on permament upgrades in between rounds. Your goal is still to defeat each of the bosses one at a time, until you unlock the final one and move on to New Game+. The nitty-gritty in between, however, is where the game was expanded substantially.

There is a bigger emphasis on movement abilities, which you will unlock in the course of runs, metroidvania-style. Each class now has its own unique weapon and playstyle, expressed in a far deeper stat system. A new relic system adds lots of wacky twists and modifiers to each individual run, which you will need to experiment with to prepare for the far more complex bossfights. All done in much better visuals and sound.

But the usual trappings of Roguelite still apply - there will be instances of deep frustration with the RNG, as well as times where you feel like you're just spinning your wheels on the gold grind. Many a run will end prematurely simply because you decided to try a new thing, and screwed yourself over. And then of course you will get that one ""god run"" that feels ecstatic.

308,116648102,english,"I wish I could rate this just okay or so-so. Rogue Legacy 2 certainly has more than the original Rogue Legacy, but it's not necessarily more GOOD. The more I play it, the more I am led to believe that the developers were never entirely sure what lightning in a bottle they captured that made the first installment so successful, and as a result have simply dialed up everything to 11 hoping that something will stick. There's more classes, weapons, skills, enemies, etc., but there's ten times the amount of garbage you will have to deal with experiencing it.

The grind is obviously part of the experience of this game, and is put front-and-center with the iterative upgrades you buy after each run attempt, but feels orders of magnitude worse than the previous title. The risk-reward proposition in this game is abysmal. The game will highly discourage you from taking any risks and instead you will quickly find that you will amass much more treasure and experience by steamrolling lower-difficulty areas over and over rather than attempting somewhere more challenging, where you will eventually be killed in two or three hits. Damage can come from anywhere, and projectiles often move faster than you can react, with projectiles or traps coming from offscreen to whittle a third of your health down after you've already scoped out your plan for things on the screen. The end result is often expending your mechanical resources of an extra jump or dash to cleanly eliminate what is on screen, but now that you air in midair and have those mechanics disabled until you touch down, you can easily be tagged by new things that have entered the screen after executing your plan. Normally having to react to things is such a standard part of video games that it seems almost ridiculous to mention something like this at all, but it will happen to you SO MUCH in RL2 that it bears mention. You WILL be tagged by things coming from offscreen, you WILL be hit by attacks that make no sense, and you WILL die to BS, over and over again. To some people, this grind can be exciting, as it becomes more akin to gambling, hoping to get lucky and not spin bankrupt rather than outplaying the enemies, but to me I find it tedious.

Enemy telegraphs in this game are abysmal, and I don't mean in the ""enemy makes a windup motion and then you react"" sense. I mean, an enemy will clearly show that they are executing some sort of attack, but instead of it being something you can safely react to or learn from, it will suddenly be a fast-moving projectile that will shoot through walls to hit you. Why does an enemy who only appears to have a melee weapon have an attack like this? Why do some projectiles go through walls and others don't? There's dozens of overengineered mechanics in this game ranging from several kinds of weights and how they affect what you can pick up without ruining your max health, down to several currencies, bonuses, debuffs, and all these things which should really just be taking a backseat to the hack and slash mechanics. I doubt many players care that their new armor gives them plus seventeen smeerps instead of fifteen, when the areas you want to explore will still kill you in three hits. The upgrades are so incrementally tiny, it feels like garbage even sinking points into any of them at all.

There's simply so much crammed into this game that don't strictly make it better that bothers me. There's lore books shoehorned in in the most hamfisted manner, sidequests which are vague enough that even when you know exactly what a riddle is referring to, you will still fail because you were standing two inches too far away to trigger a secret door. Just google this stuff, it's legitimately not worth trying to solve the riddles, especially since it just leads to more ways to obtain more nonsense currencies that let you buy more tiny upgrades, seriously, sometimes simplicity is better.

Multiple runs in this game are tiring and overtly repetitive, something that is not good for a roguelite or any game that has ""rogue"" so brazenly spotlit in the title. I want to experience all this game has to offer but this gameplay loop is trying my patience and you can get about triple the dopamine per run in many other similar roguelites. RL2 isn't bad, it's not great, and it really is just about as okay as RL1, with a more convoluted path to the golden gameplay loop that seems to take the backseat.

However if youre experienced in these sorts of games you might find a lot of smaller things that will hinder your enjoyment.



MILD GAMEPLAY SPOILERS AHEAD

This isn't really a ""not recommended"" but as steam doesnt have a mid option, this is what im going with.

this one hurts, genuinely. Rogue Legacy 1 is a game i still hold dear to my heart as it was the first game that i consciously played as an ""Indie Game"" and got me started to look deeper into smaller games. (i think it also was my first rogue-like, but not 100% if i didnt play BoI first)

So let me start this out by saying this: If you're looking for a foundationally solid rogue-lite experience with great art and some quirks, this game is not a bad choice by any means, and you can certainly have fun with it.

However, while I replayed RL1 a bunch of times, including beating the game in just a couple generations and going into NG+[high number i dont remember] , at some point i decided to just get through the rest of the game and be done with it, and now that im done, i have no desire to ever open it up again and very mixed feelings if i actually enjoyed these 18 hours.

[b]1) Professional Polishers[/b]

So where are the issues? Honestly, Its hard to pin down but there are a lot of smaller things that add up. Like already said, the graphics are great, the foundation is solid, the controls are responsive, the basic combat is polished...

...but here we come to our first and main type of issue: Everythings just a little too polished. I firmly believe that rogue-likes are a genre that shouldnt be polished too much. It requires unbalanced things, it requires quirky moments, it requires useless but fun roads to go down. Binding of Isaac is maybe the most unbalanced rogue-like ever and maybe the greatest, so that should tell you somethings. The nature of it is that it builds on randomness and variety.

Heres an example of what i mean: RL1 had traits that made the game way harder (think vertigo) for no compensation whatsoever. Does that mean vertigo was a bad addition to the game? I would argue no, i still picked a vertigo character occasionally for funsies. RL2 meanwhile introduces welfare, meaning you get a percentage money bonus depending on how bad a trait is. No more funsies, now thats a balanced tradeoff. (it also feels like theres way less traits, the amount of times ive looked at my options and all 3 had no traits was baffling to me)

This extends to other parts of the game as well. Another Example: You have a relic system thats expanded way beyond what RL1 had just so you can give the player 10% bonus damage in certain situations. Also you can only have so many relics before your HP takes a hit, how much is correlated to your equipment. Why have it be this advanced and then barely affect the gameplay? Except for 1-2 runs the relics felt absolutely pointless.

Locking class, rerolling and more options so you can always have pretty much the exact character you want! sounds great right? until you realize it ruins the variety of the game while being the theoretical best play.

[b]2) Metroidvania?[/b]

The game tries to go into the metroidvania direction but leaves very little room for exploration early on. you get an heirloom, you unlock one new area, where you get an heirloom that unlocks the next area... The game even straight up tells you ""this is area number X"".

It feels like its being done just for the buzzword and less for its actual contribution to the gameplay. And its made worse by...

[b]3) Grinddddddd [/b]

Now i wanna reiterate that while i make it sound like these are massive fuckups each and every one, none of them are by themselves. If this game for example only had issues with too balanced relics and traits, it would still be a great game. And similarly to the next point: There are definitely grindier rogue-likes out there. However, unless you bang your head against a wall like I did in the end, you'll likely still have to grind. And its just not rewarding. Why exactly is hard to pin down, but i think it comes from the overwhelming amount of things to invest in vs. what you can actually manage in a NG and the in comparison to that fairly quick price increase. Also going back to polish, i noticed in the beginning that with the same money bonus i always ended up with pretty much the exact same amount of money after clearing the citadel out +-100. Which sounds brilliant on paper, but makes the grind even less exciting.

I beat RL1 in just a couple generations without too much issue. This here feels impossible (im sure it isnt actually). It makes the grinding feel mandatory, while in RL1 it felt like an option to make it a bit easier.

[b]4) Variety until there isnt [/b]

Riddle me this: In a sequel, whos main difference is that different classes now have different weapons that work completely differently, why have XP per class? That just points towards maining 1-2 classes and ignoring the rest. Again, the bonus you get from XP is fairly miniscule, like everything here its a minor point, but it pushes you in the imho wrong direction.

Another issue personally is that due to enemies tendency to run into you, classes that didnt allow moving while attacking/stunned you for a second when attacking felt really static and unfun in comparison, which again made me wanna limit myself to just a few classes. For a while i forced myself to pick the other ones regularly but eventually i gave up on that towards the end.

[b]5) combat [/b]

so you have like 4 ways to counter projectiles in a somtimes bullet hell-like game where positioning matters and you have to keep track of mana, skill cooldown, etc.. It gets overwhelming sometimes. Which would be fine in most games but again, it a rogue-lite, a genre which is about just playing until it works, its imho the wrong decision to complicate things so much.

[b]6) and lots of lots of other small things [/b]

so i dont write an essay heres a rundown of more smaller things that bothered me:

[list]
[*] I dont have anything to base it on but it felt like there were just as many different enemies and rooms in RL2 as there were in RL1 while RL2 is a bigger game
[*] half the bosses are quite neat, half arent
[*] i hunted for fairy chests and spent a bunch on being able to find more runes and still struggled to fill out the rune weight i could carry with runes i wanted
[*] why are iron and blood currencies a thing? 
[*] Some of the dialogue is long winded and tries too hard to be funny imo
[*] heirlooms apparently have a personality each just so they can speak... 2 sentences?
[*] wtf is the difficulty spike from area 4 to 5
[*] some of the side content like the is unsatisfying and just not that fun
[*] ...
[/list]

i could go on but i leave it here. I hope you get the point. None of these points would be enough. Theyre all fairly miniscule but just add up.

314,117371145,english,"So, let me start off by saying that I wanted to finish the game twice before giving this review, just to make sure its not just my initial excitement talking. What I want to say is that this game has been designed to be completed. Its not designed to frustrate or waste your time. The reason that I say this is that for every mechanic that makes this title roguelike, there is an unlock you can purchase by playing the game, and making the experience less random and more focused on progressing.

Now to continue I will try to explain what I mean by ""designed to be completed and not waste your time"" to the best of my ability, with the mention that the review contains spoilers, and you can always youtube this and get a tutorial or just see general gameplay.

The mechanics of the game are as follows: every run you get a random map and 3 random heroes to choose from (with your options increasing as you unlock more classes. You can obtain 4 types of resources: gold, blood, ore and soul. At the start of each run (following your death) you have to give your gold away (or portion of it) but you keep all blood, ore and soul and everything you unlocked, including passive experience gains, gear, runes, etc.

Now, as you progress, you unlock mechanics to counteract the randomness of the game, such as: 
- very close to the start of the game you unlock the ""Arhitect"" which will lock the world in place as many runs as you want, at an increasingly tax on your gold gains. I use this a lot to focus on a specific boss, because the valuable resources the boss drops are not affected by the Arhitect penalty, just the gold gain. 
- teleporter at the start of each biome unlocked permanently to allow you to focus on a specific biome. I try to unlock the Axis Mundi permanent teleporter due to the passive 20% gold gain and somewhat easy map.
- the ability to start various challenges as many times as you want which in turn reward the Soul resources.

In the end of this review I want to mention that for me, for my style of play, I felt respected as a player and my time valued.
I usually stay away from wasting my time with roguelikes and roguelites because I feel most of them are designed to frustrate and create a fake ""skill barrier"" which is actually empty content and lack of ideas wrapped under a toxic ""be pro or get out"" banner. This game can be difficult at times, but its always fun, and I don't remember a single run where I felt my time was wasted.",1655839364,1655839675,True,2,0,0.531656563282012939,0,True,False,False,76561198133187394,140,3,9339,6005,7749,1656066719,1253920.0

317,117464925,english,"Rogue Legacy 2 is one of those rare sequels where the developers took everything about the original that made it work and just improved on all those aspects while funneling more and more new ideas to make Rogue Legacy feel fresh and modern again. This is a much bigger and bolder game than its predecessor with a larger world, Metroidvania elements, and far more complex roguelike and RPG mechanics meant to add as much depth as possible to every run, and it is all the better for it. Unlike the original, every character has their unique move set and weapon attributed to their class instead of just stat changeups in the original, this change removes so much monotony that could be found in the mid-game of Rogue Legacy and replaced it with a far higher skill ceiling where every run will you feel as though you accomplished at least one thing. The controls are also far tighter with the Sun Tower area showing off how great the platforming is with some small additions to every hero's move set.

I guess if any game were to do it, it'd be Rogue Legacy's sequel. If you liked the first game, buy this right now. It's nothing but improvements over the original. Graphically, it looks stunning, it's absolutely addicting, controls amazingly, and the post game content is very fun too. I'm on NG+2 right now and it's really fun to blitz through the game while setting new gold records every other run.

All of the new features are extremely well implemented. Spin kicking is such an amazing mechanic, and it honestly makes me never wanna go back to the first game. If you've played Isaac- you know how Binding of Isaac: Rebirth basically made the original Flash Isaac redundant? Yeah, we've got another case of that. Seriously, what an improvement over the original.

It's easily a contender for one my favorite Roguelikes, and trust me, I play a [i]lot[/i] of Roguelikes. It's got everything you'd want from a sequel, and even if you haven't played the original, what you've got here is an extremely well made Roguelike platformer. 

The only bad thing I have to say about it is that I think the writing is a little eh. Too many pizza jokes. Plus the story doesn't make sense unless you literally read the lore bible the game slowly dumps on you as you play.

351,116701078,english,"Overall, I'm really enjoying this game. I would give it a solid 8/10 and I'll probably put another couple dozen hours into it. The platforming feels great, the combat is snappy, and each new biome has a nice hook to keep things interesting. And there's definitely a lot of content if you're looking for a good grind.

However, I will say that enjoying this game requires resetting some expectations - although it's structurally very similar to a lot of roguelikes out there, it has a very different ""feel."" Most importantly, it's not really a build-focused game, even though it looks like it should be one. You might occasionally get a perk or relic that matches up really well with something else, but there's nowhere near the depth you would find in something like Dead Cells or Risk of Rain. It's much more about the classes, which is totally fine for me because there are so many of them and they all have nice differences in how they play. 

Secondly, it's a lot more like a side-scrolling ARPG (except for the build crafting, like I said) than a traditional Metroidvania platformer. Individual enemies have very basic attacks and patterns; it's less about engaging with any particular enemy and reacting to their actions, and more about managing larger groups and using abilities in fairly well-defined cycles. Again, I had no problem with this, but you're going to be disappointed if you want something more Dark Souls or Dead Cells (parrying, blocking, rolling, etc).

Finally, the actual ""gimmick"" of the game, the ancestor system, is really not as important as you might think. 90% of a run will be determined by the class you pick, while the genetic traits are usually pretty minor. I almost wish some of the other mechanics had been eliminated and repurposed as additional genetic traits, because right now the game feels a little light in that area - which is weird, because it's sorta the whole point of the game!

But don't let these things scare you off - it's still a really fun game that has a ton of polish and a ton of content. Just go in on the game's terms instead of assuming it'll be like games that *look* the same and I think you'll enjoy it.",1654735359,1654735359,True,1,0,0.509090900421142578,0,True,False,False,76561197979563122,589,71,2329,504,1769,1655778354,1253920.0

[i]A franchise I was never interested in, because I heard it is heavily focused on grinding and grinding and more grinding. Well it is still, but Monster Hunter Rise (MHR for now on) makes it bearable. Let's see...[/i]


[b]Story:[/b]
As far as I know this game has the standard MH formula: Village gets threatened by Monsters and you are the chosen hunter saving the day. That is all!
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2742903689
[b]Gameplay:[/b]
You start out learning how to hunt, collect and craft in just under two hours in a really well made tutorial. This is also the major gameplay loop: 

Choose a mission -> Prepare yourself -> Find the Monster -> Hunt it -> Loot Monster Materials -> Get your reward -> Craft new gear using the Monster Materials

You don't have enough materials to craft a new set of armor/weapon? Repeat! I can tell you there are a lot of different Armors so you either play 24/7 or just grind for the one you want to have the most!

This is all you do the whole time. It might sound tireing at first, but every hunt is different. Each monster reacts in a different way and has different attack patterns. If you are not prepared well enough, you might get into some problems in the harder challenges. Traversing on the four fairly large maps is also a piece of cake. You have your trusty wolf who carries you around. The pets you have are also a part that makes this game way more enjoyable and they help you in combat as well!

To help you achieving your goal you have many different weapon types with different styles and combos:
[list]
[*]Sword and Shield
[*]Dual Blades
[*]Light Bowgun
[*]Great Sword
[*]Long Sword
[*]Hammer
[*]Gunlance
[*]Switch Axe
[*]Hunting Horn
[*]Insect Glaive
[*]Heavy Bowgun
[*]Bow
[*]Charge Blade
[*]Lance
[/list]
For beginners I suggest using the Hammer. Super fun weapon and easy to use! It is also a good way not to get bored, because for each weapon you need to invest a little bit of time to learn new combos and learn how to use them more efficiently. You can train the basics in a special training ground, but to ""git gud"" you should really check out tutorials on YouTube as well.

Next to the normal hunts there is also the ""Rampage"" mode. It is more like an (optional) towerdefense game and I am not going to waste my time explaining it. For me it is the most unfun part of the game. There are 2 or 3 Rampage missions you have to do and there are also materials that drop only there. Maybe you like it, but if not, there are also a lot of ""cheese"" videos on YouTube which helped me getting passed these missions.

Last but not least: Play with a gamepad! If you play bow or guns you can also use the mouse and play the game like a third person shooter (It really makes fun!), but for everything else.... Gamepad!


[b]Coop-Mode:[/b]
I played this game together with a gaming buddy and it just worked really well. No issues at all and stable ping!


[b]Graphics[/b]
It is a switch port so don't expect a lot here. The game and its regions (especially the village) look breathtaking, but it is by no means ""Next Gen"".
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2736121347
[b]Soundtrack[/b]
There are some catchy tunes and the Monster Hunter maintheme is on point, but what really blew my mind is that each monster has its own Soundtrack. And they are all so beautiful! Nothing to complain about at all.


[b]Conclusion[/b]
Worth it! The game is fun and the grind isnt as bad as in any other games of the series. I also heard that it is more arcade and more ""easy to learn"" than any other MH game (which was a reason for me to give it a try).

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching some tiktok videos. So i decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died.

But this game is not Capcoms best achievement within that series by a long shot in my view.
From a technical standpoint this game is fine. Nothing major but its a switchport to pc so no hard feeling there.
Contentwise i could talk for hours how this game disappointed me. 
Here the biggest points:
-Bland maps with no love for detail especially compared to MHW 
-A lot a recycled monsters and not much special new ones i feel
-Nice but at time to easy gameplay
-The speed of the palamute and new acrobatic skills makes ""getting to know the map"" redundant 
-The mobility of the silkbindmoves makes ""getting to know the monster"" redundant 

The gameplayloop now just feel like ""Get in, rush to the Monster(since you already know where it is for some reason), make your flashy moves, 10 minutes later its dead. I had no reason until now to grind, or do any preparations for any quest. Given, im not finished with the game. on switch im around 7-starquests but even there i managed to kill 7-star monsters with 4 stargear and that is centainly not because im a good player.
I still have high hopes for sunbreak and will buy and play it and I will probably also preorder and play the next Monster Hunter Game but tbh I dont see a reason why someone new to MH would start to love these games as much as I do based on this game by itself. 
Can't recommend it sadly.

It's the fastest and most action-packed the MonHun formula has been so far with plenty to craft and work towards with engaging fights that never make you feel like you're grinding - it's so much fun running around the map and slapping beasts around that you'll forget in the moment that you're even working toward some crafting goal or quest chain or whatever in the background.

Tons of variety in the weapon movesets that you can truly ""play it your way"", whether you wanna run in and mash buttons for flashy combos that look cool, be a supportive tank, play with precision hits and dodges, or sit back and enjoy the game as a third-person shooter.

Music and sound are incredible, the graphics of course from a technical standpoint don't live up to the last game due to codevelopment for Switch but the color and art style more than make up for it - you'd have to be the snootiest of fidelity whores to be put off by how this game looks once the fights start moving.

So you run around getting fat birbs to give you quest-bound boosts if you are nab, or you run to the monster location as fast as you can if you have hands, then they die in 5 minutes because you are the monster and they are the prey (2 minutes if you use broken weapons like HBG, LBG, Bow)

Compared to World having those awful mantles, here you have to actually dodge stuff... or not, as monsters do very little damage and you can use your shiny cockroach to get up in more or less the same amount of time i needed to fall in love with Hinoa: her, and her sister, are probably the best thing this game has to offer, as the very first line you hear when you start is ""Ara Ara~"" from Hinoa.

No more garbage clutch claw, this time the shiny cockroach can bind monsters and lets you ride them to do 20% of the target's health with no effort because the game is indeed too hard, and they needed to give casual players even more reasons to literally not fight properly

New mode, rampages, just don't do them as they are boring af and you can not lose them unless you are 100% afk, they'll be deprecated in Sunbreak (thank god), so try them and if you like them then do some for the tickets i guess... some rampage weapons are meta after all

Oh, good luck completing achievements, as you need to do useless stuff like getting 1000 golden bugs, picking up 500 endemic helpers, photograph all the endemic life, and many other very-much-monster-hunting unrelated boring stuff, so if you are one of those weird people playing games only for achievements, keep this in mind

Monster hunter game never fail to make me so addicted and keep grinding like a maniac to be greatest hunter.
Mh rise give me the vibe of monster hunter in 3ds back then, though yes it felt easier and faster than mhw or monster hunter back then but as eventually you meet more quicker and harder monster, it would equal and balance the system.
Really happy having palamutes!! geez they so adorable and my wish for able go faster to a location is granted xD though with wire bug we still can be ninja :) but still palicos the most useful and aggresive one than pamultes xD

I thought i would hating rampage but oh boy i was wrong, i really love it doing defend thing protecting the village and it goes more crazy in online xD.
Finally i can play co op better and easier to connect here than in mhw :'3 though not the perfect co op system and connection of it but its still better than in mhw.
Mh rise its like more 3ds game with japan feel and more fast paced meanwhile mhw felt more tradtional monster hunter game like in era ps2 with steady pace, both of the game its amazing!! each of them have their own cons and pro but one thing never change its both of them able make me forget about reality and just keep playing non stop slaying the monster lol xD

The weapon and armor design in rise also more better and creative here than in mhw, sometime weird and hilarious type would make you speechless in funny way xD
The greatest thing that this game is more lighter and more friendly spec than mhw though the graphic rise is lost to mhw but its just bit that u wouldn't even notice.
I hope they can serve us more diff japan food rather than only dangos >< i mean i was a hunter who freaking hunting large monster so how tf i will get full with just eating dangos xD oh man how i miss eating the buffet in mhw who keep make me drooling over it but in rise i only get eat dangos xd.

Story wise still good though not as good mhw but its still have decent story, though monster hunter never have superb story xD.
I wish they add more monster cause i still felt like the monster list in rise not much or its just cause i'm too horny already slain them all xD
Also you knew rise have good intros, for our char get ara ara by twins is really something ;)
If you are monster hunter lover you would love it and felt like you playing the old monster hunter games though with more easier and faster pace but it still worth to play and be top hunter.
Even for new players is still good cause the game so friendly and would guide you through the game and help you understand the mechanic and finally be great hunter itself.

Playing rise can felt more arcade and easier cause there so much instant stuff and i can see why people said mhw is harder than rise but its doesnt make the game not challenge anymore, rise still challenging and it have own uniqueness for it as like how mhw is, and rise add much new fresh stuff to the game so its awesome though its have some minor but its still joyful.
I can't wait for new monster hunter and i need prepare my wallet for the dlc for mhw and rise xD.
Honestly mhr rise price seem kinda too pricey and even higher than mhw who obviously more bigger spec and size but oh well xD.
I suggest you take it on sale but if you really love monster hunter francise and have the money then feel free to buy this lovely game <3.",1654160202,1654160202,True,3,0,0.531421005725860596,0,True,False,False,76561198401010369,150,14,4701,13,4688,1656049923,1446780.0

470,116947226,english,"My first experience with Monster Hunter was World. And World is massive and it has great graphics and a ton of content. So I was worried I wouldn't enjoy Rise due to the comparison. 

But I was wrong. Is it world? No. For better and worse. No more grinding tracking quests and though the world is smaller its also more streamlined for the combat.  

The world is less alive and a bit more arcady, But that's not an entirely bad thing. Tracking is gone for the most part. Endemic life are kind of like buffs you pick up on the way. I love things like the stink mink that can trigger turf wars. I don't recall seeing nearly as many interesting environmental  traps as world but you can easily stun and stagger monsters by puppetering them against each other and using other monsters to beat the tar out of your target

The wirebugs are an interesting addition. Probably less controversial than Iceborne's ClutchClaw though. But I understand if the riding monsters like Remy from Ratatoullie isn't exactly your thing. I found it funny though.

If I was given the choice I don't think I'd over pick a Palico over a Palamute from here on out though. I love  those pony sized dogs. 

As for the monster roster itself its solid.  I really enjoyed the fights and my playthrough with the switch axe. And for the roster I was a pretty big fan. Tons of intense fights and great designs.  Some annoying returns from older series but I didn't mind them so much. Its not G rank so not as hard as iceborne was though. I am very much average and was able to solo every fight after enough tries.

The Rampage mode was a bit of a gimmick I could have done without. neat idea. Meh execution. I did the bare minimum to progress the story.  Slapping tower defenses onto your not tower defense game isn't always the wisest move.

Its a solid Monster Hunter experience. If you liked World this one should scratch that itch.",1655163241,1655163330,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,76561197970637744,529,25,6198,804,5402,1656039070,1446780.0

491,116401836,english,"I've played this game for 130 hours on the Switch on one character, and 90 on PC apparently, across 2. 

Right off the bat, yes, this is the easiest MonHun game that has ever been released. I was into the second to last rank of hub quests within 16 hours of my second character's playthrough, and I wasn't struggling whatsoever. What is the reason for the seemingly drastic drop in difficulty? If I had to put my finger on it, it's the wirebugs. You are simply way way more mobile than ever before in the series, and while some of the newer monsters are better equipped to handle this, the returning ones for the most part do not handle it well.

The trade-off is that you get the absolute fastest gameplay we've ever had. You're not going to have to slog through a long tedious adventure like World here. The story is about as good as you can expect out of a MonHun game, but it isn't obnoxiously in your face and it does not slow you down like it did there. Weapons feel great for the most part and the silkbind skills are reminiscent of the hunter arts from Gen/GenU. If you're seeking a ""pure"" monster hunter experience, you will not find that here. I believe those days are gone.

Palamutes are an addition made to help traverse the much larger, open environments. They're not much different from palicos aside from that. Said environments are much simpler than the clusters of map from World that at times absolutely required the guide bugs to get around. Looking at you, Ancient Forest. It still feels like all other titles in that there are ""main"" spots where you'll be doing your fighting with a bunch of connecting tunnels and paths where monsters will just continue running along despite you hitting them. It's still the old zones, just gussied up. 

Graphically it's obviously a downgrade from World. It's still got a nice cohesive style, and PC only players have no idea how good they've got it if they never tried the original Switch version. The difference is beyond night and day. The game runs like butter on my UW monitor at 1440p, around 120 fps. Everything is sharp and vibrant.

I've been playing MonHun since Freedom 2 on the PSP, and Rise is not my favorite of the series. All this succinctly said, it's a solid entry that's fun with friends, if a bit too easy. At this point in time with the expansion about to drop, this game is not worth paying $60 for. You will get your money's worth in regards to how much time you can squeeze out of it, but it's incomplete content as these first versions always are.

This game follows the structure of games like Mario Kart in that it's a kart racing game that allows the collection and use of items and boosts. It features fun designed courses, customizable karts/characters, and the ability to race against your friends or the computer.

Pros
* Character customization
* Multiple karts to choose from
* Aesthetically pleasing courses
* Multi-player (1-4)
* Fullscreen mode
* A tutorials page that goes over the items, controls, and etcetera
* Option between doing a single race or a grand prix style match up
* The screen transitions are instant, and the races load very fast as well (less than a second for me)
* Plenty of items that can be used during a race
* Incentive to collect coins to earn a boost ability

It should be noted for people debating to download this game, it does only have three courses, a few characters, and a lack of ""content"". However, this should not discourage anyone from downloading and playing the game, and I suggest everyone that wants to support the developers to give the game a try. It's a fun game.

Notes
* A mobile version of this game with auto-matchmaking is something I could see being a big hit.
* I enjoyed the game and look forward to seeing where this goes, and wish the developers luck.",1590611314,1590683796,True,30,0,0.738465249538421631,0,False,False,False,76561198067648136,51,1,48,0,48,1590611113,1062100.0
504,69914785,english,"As someone who has put hundreds of hours into a certain kart game, I really enjoyed playing this. It has impressive quality for a free game.

Pros:
- I definitely felt a rush of adrenaline in trying to get first place on every course
- Unique button boost mechanic leads to replayability in trying to optimize your laps
- Useful hidden techniques that the player has to discover for themselves
- Plays well with both keyboard and gamepad
- Great course design and informative but clean UI
- The little details that add to the package (course intro sequences, character customization)

My Nitpicks:
- Sometimes there is a disconnect between hazard placement and when it can affect you.
- Sound effects can occasionally get louder than usual
- Some unexpected item physics

Other Comments:
- I would love to see some type of time trial implemented to see if i'm actually going faster with my sick techniques

523,69907917,english,"So, as a heads up to anyone that downloads this game, as I understand it this game is currently being developed by a group of students and is being offered for free, so please keep that in mind when downloading and reviewing this game.

This game follows the structure of games like Mario Kart in that it's a kart racing game that allows the collection and use of items and boosts. It features fun designed courses, customizable karts/characters, and the ability to race against your friends or the computer.

Pros
* Character customization
* Multiple karts to choose from
* Aesthetically pleasing courses
* Multi-player (1-4)
* Fullscreen mode
* A tutorials page that goes over the items, controls, and etcetera
* Option between doing a single race or a grand prix style match up
* The screen transitions are instant, and the races load very fast as well (less than a second for me)
* Plenty of items that can be used during a race
* Incentive to collect coins to earn a boost ability

It should be noted for people debating to download this game, it does only have three courses, a few characters, and a lack of ""content"". However, this should not discourage anyone from downloading and playing the game, and I suggest everyone that wants to support the developers to give the game a try. It's a fun game.

Notes
* A mobile version of this game with auto-matchmaking is something I could see being a big hit.
* I enjoyed the game and look forward to seeing where this goes, and wish the developers luck.",1590611314,1590683796,True,30,0,0.738465249538421631,0,False,False,False,76561198067648136,51,1,48,0,48,1590611113,1062100.0
524,69914785,english,"As someone who has put hundreds of hours into a certain kart game, I really enjoyed playing this. It has impressive quality for a free game.

Pros:
- I definitely felt a rush of adrenaline in trying to get first place on every course
- Unique button boost mechanic leads to replayability in trying to optimize your laps
- Useful hidden techniques that the player has to discover for themselves
- Plays well with both keyboard and gamepad
- Great course design and informative but clean UI
- The little details that add to the package (course intro sequences, character customization)

My Nitpicks:
- Sometimes there is a disconnect between hazard placement and when it can affect you.
- Sound effects can occasionally get louder than usual
- Some unexpected item physics

Other Comments:
- I would love to see some type of time trial implemented to see if i'm actually going faster with my sick techniques
- It would be cool to see more variety in racetrack textures
- Letting one player use keyboard and a second player use the gamepad may lead to more accessible multiplayer options
- I have no idea if certain characters and karts give different stat boosts but I like to imagine they do!

Plays really well with very few glitches. One minor complaint is that the race will not end until everyone has crossed the finish line, so you may be waiting several minutes for the slowest racers to finally finish.

A funny thing I encountered one time was after finishing a race, when my car was being driven automatically, the ai kept driving the car off the edge of the track over and over again in an infinite loop until the race concluded.

559,70175809,english,"Mario Kart styled cartoony racing game with boost pads and items, using childrens' toys as the aesthetic for everything. 

Only 3 tracks and can only choose from single race or a grand prix to go through all 3. Doesn't feel fast paced at all unless you're using boosts and even then it isn't all that much.

Items feel similar to Mario Kart items such as rockets acting like red shells, ink you can splat on the ground behind you, marbles you can throw in front or behind like green shells...

Most likely more fun with friends as you'll all be playing much smarter to ruin each other's shortcut jumps with specific items (hitting someone with a rocket as they're going off a jump feels like the experience in Mario Kart where you hit them with lightning or a blue shell in the same situation) 

Decent enough to kill a little time but needs more work and more content to be replayable.

My first gripe is the speed. The driving feels way too slow. I get that you're racing in toy cars (made out of things like wooden blocks, soda bottles, buttons, and lollipops) but if it's going to be a race, it needs some more speed to it. A suggestion would be to keep the current speed as the default and increase speed bit by bit as a racer gets more gold buttons. Make a player consider spending them for a temporary boost or keep them for a faster constant speed.

Second, AI difficulty. After a race or two to get the hang of drift boosts and learning what each item does and how to use them, the races aren't all that hard at all. The AI racers seem to use their items as soon as they get them rather than trying to hit you with them at the best times to mess you up. Having harder difficulty AI, and a difficulty selection, would make things a little more fun.

Third, more content. More tracks, items, characters (or at least color schemes for the existing ones), options for the karts... Just to give some variety. 

Other small nitpicks:
Customization selections. A red box as your current selected option and a red box to show what option you're hovering over isn't a good combination. Differentiate between what's selected and what you're hovering over.

Drift boost gauge. This one's just a personal preference but I'd rather see something subtle like what Mario Kart does with the orange and blue sparks when drifting instead of seeing a blue bar filling up across the screen.

Still, I'd say it's worth checking out. It's free, and has local split-screen multiplayer (you can also use Steam's Remote Play Together feature to play online.)

This game follows the structure of games like Mario Kart in that it's a kart racing game that allows the collection and use of items and boosts. It features fun designed courses, customizable karts/characters, and the ability to race against your friends or the computer.

Pros
* Character customization
* Multiple karts to choose from
* Aesthetically pleasing courses
* Multi-player (1-4)
* Fullscreen mode
* A tutorials page that goes over the items, controls, and etcetera
* Option between doing a single race or a grand prix style match up
* The screen transitions are instant, and the races load very fast as well (less than a second for me)
* Plenty of items that can be used during a race
* Incentive to collect coins to earn a boost ability

It should be noted for people debating to download this game, it does only have three courses, a few characters, and a lack of ""content"". However, this should not discourage anyone from downloading and playing the game, and I suggest everyone that wants to support the developers to give the game a try. It's a fun game.

Notes
* A mobile version of this game with auto-matchmaking is something I could see being a big hit.
* I enjoyed the game and look forward to seeing where this goes, and wish the developers luck.",1590611314,1590683796,True,30,0,0.738465249538421631,0,False,False,False,76561198067648136,51,1,48,0,48,1590611113,1062100.0
563,69914785,english,"As someone who has put hundreds of hours into a certain kart game, I really enjoyed playing this. It has impressive quality for a free game.

Pros:
- I definitely felt a rush of adrenaline in trying to get first place on every course
- Unique button boost mechanic leads to replayability in trying to optimize your laps
- Useful hidden techniques that the player has to discover for themselves
- Plays well with both keyboard and gamepad
- Great course design and informative but clean UI
- The little details that add to the package (course intro sequences, character customization)

My Nitpicks:
- Sometimes there is a disconnect between hazard placement and when it can affect you.
- Sound effects can occasionally get louder than usual
- Some unexpected item physics

Other Comments:
- I would love to see some type of time trial implemented to see if i'm actually going faster with my sick techniques
- It would be cool to see more variety in racetrack textures
- Letting one player use keyboard and a second player use the gamepad may lead to more accessible multiplayer options
- I have no idea if certain characters and karts give different stat boosts but I like to imagine they do!

The items were pretty straight forward, and easy to understand without even playing a tutorial, but the boosting to catch the shortcuts is tricky at times, so careful with that! I really enjoyed the idea of consuming coins to boost and use items, as it added more value and made me want to pick them up every chance I could.

This was a disappointment.
I have seen a 2 thumbs-up reviews here copy-pasting exact words in each others' review.

Positive:

Controls works fine. 
Cute 'Kinder-Surprise' type figurines characters
Customisable Kart outlook and wheels (don't think it has any status advantages)
Appearances of the weapons and karts and the track are imaginative. 
Mario-Kart style type attempt of a racing car game (Buttons: items, boost, drift, accelerate, left and right, pause,reverse).

Negatives:

After going past the starting line in the 2nd stage (bathroom), all the cars (including the COMs) were flying in the air /levitating off track, until after half of the track has been covered, our car managed to finally land on the ground. 

Passing the finish line doesn't mean the software records your lap as 2nd lap. The number doesn't change/record at all.

I tried to look for the graphics option to lower the frame rates, unfortunately, there isn't any options for graphics other than screen size and sound options.

I would say it is possible that it the programming has gone wrong.

Overall:

I would really say, avoid. Me and my husband have no idea what we have just 'played'. But as it is free, try it yourself, and you will get what I mean.

Plays really well with very few glitches. One minor complaint is that the race will not end until everyone has crossed the finish line, so you may be waiting several minutes for the slowest racers to finally finish.

A funny thing I encountered one time was after finishing a race, when my car was being driven automatically, the ai kept driving the car off the edge of the track over and over again in an infinite loop until the race concluded.

598,70175809,english,"Mario Kart styled cartoony racing game with boost pads and items, using childrens' toys as the aesthetic for everything. 

Only 3 tracks and can only choose from single race or a grand prix to go through all 3. Doesn't feel fast paced at all unless you're using boosts and even then it isn't all that much.

Items feel similar to Mario Kart items such as rockets acting like red shells, ink you can splat on the ground behind you, marbles you can throw in front or behind like green shells...

Most likely more fun with friends as you'll all be playing much smarter to ruin each other's shortcut jumps with specific items (hitting someone with a rocket as they're going off a jump feels like the experience in Mario Kart where you hit them with lightning or a blue shell in the same situation) 

Decent enough to kill a little time but needs more work and more content to be replayable.

My first gripe is the speed. The driving feels way too slow. I get that you're racing in toy cars (made out of things like wooden blocks, soda bottles, buttons, and lollipops) but if it's going to be a race, it needs some more speed to it. A suggestion would be to keep the current speed as the default and increase speed bit by bit as a racer gets more gold buttons. Make a player consider spending them for a temporary boost or keep them for a faster constant speed.

Second, AI difficulty. After a race or two to get the hang of drift boosts and learning what each item does and how to use them, the races aren't all that hard at all. The AI racers seem to use their items as soon as they get them rather than trying to hit you with them at the best times to mess you up. Having harder difficulty AI, and a difficulty selection, would make things a little more fun.

Third, more content. More tracks, items, characters (or at least color schemes for the existing ones), options for the karts... Just to give some variety. 

Other small nitpicks:
Customization selections. A red box as your current selected option and a red box to show what option you're hovering over isn't a good combination. Differentiate between what's selected and what you're hovering over.

Drift boost gauge. This one's just a personal preference but I'd rather see something subtle like what Mario Kart does with the orange and blue sparks when drifting instead of seeing a blue bar filling up across the screen.

Still, I'd say it's worth checking out. It's free, and has local split-screen multiplayer (you can also use Steam's Remote Play Together feature to play online.)

602,117445568,english,"An absolutely disgraceful collection but I did not expect anything more since it was made ""internally at SEGA""

CONS:
• Most important - NO integer scaling, meaning all 4 games look just as blurry as Sonic CD 2011. What was the point of finally releasing the 2013 remasters on consoles if they look worse than when they did on mobile?
• Mission Mode is comprised of bite-sized, generically-designed levels that would make the most amateur platformers blush. I could tell it was made by Sonic Team cuz the mode features grey X-blocks like Forces and they're EVERYWHERE with no slopes in sight
• Amy/Knuckles isn't playable in CD (a primarily exploration-themed game), and don't get me started on Amy - a character that's been promoted since the Archie Mega Drive days as part of Team Sonic. Then in Mania Adventures, then in IDW comics. So you'd think they would finally make her playable? Lol, you want them to make a new sprite-sheet? You're asking for too much
• No basic customizations. After all these years, after fan projects like S3 Complete or AIR, our boys at SEGA couldn't be bothered to add the most basic options between all 4 games like hackers/modders do. No peel-out in S3, no elemental shields in S1/CD/2, no insta-shield in CD, no Jam difficulties, no option to use lives/timeouts in Anniversary Mode or collect Tokens in Classic Mode, etc.
• Island Tour DLC just allows you to zoom-in on each island, not even rotate them. Money well spent. And that ""animated characters on island"" DLC? All of them are ripped from Gens/Forces :)
• The """"""Drop Dash"""""" is a pure lie. What do I mean? It's actually a disguised Spin Dash animation that happens for a split-second? Doesn't sound bad, except the AGES version of S1/S2 natively added it to their ROMs. Oh! And in Origins it BARELY moves you after you execute it. Best part? S1/S2 have a fixed jump arc, so if you try to do this move in those games and jump, you won't be able to control yourself mid-air (think Castlevania)
• The Museum... oh my god, remember those so-called ""never-before seen concept arts"" they promised? Well I'm here to tell you there are like 6 of them, everything else are Harmony covers and character sheets. The Video section has none of those cool 90s ads, promo videos or even documentaries, just a few pieces of the Sonic Symphony they threw in at the last hour, Origins' cutscenes and every episode of Mania Adventures (and their respective animatics). Both Normal and Premium sections offer very little content, especially if you pre-ordered the game which gives you a 100 Token bonus, you can literally unlock everything in under 2 hours. Not to mention it's complete silence, no remix of History or anything like that, no feeling of nostalgia. Just cynical, corporate silence as you browse what little stuff they offer. Only """"""new"""""" track here is a remix of Sonic World from Jam that plays everywhere except the Museum. Classy
• S1/2/CD are straight mobile versions, so they haven't been touched up at all. Meaning the missing rolling SFX in CD hasn't been fixed, and the extended camera is still absent
• Horrible audio quality. Believe it or not, they used the remastered OSTs for S1, CD and S2 from mobile. Sounds good? There are just 2 tiiiiiny problems: S3&K, y'know... the only new thing here, isn't given the same treatment so its OST is really muffled, and ON TOP OF THAT, CD's 2 OSTs are super quiet and also in bad quality. How did they screw it up? idk, but it is hilarious 
• The music DLC (Chaotix, 3D Blast and Spinball) misnamed countless tracks, so for example; the bad ending theme of Chaotix (Destructive Power) is Door to Summer while the Invincibility theme in 3D Blast is the Menu theme. Incompetent? Very much. Funny? Absolutely
• Even though I'm not one of those people that plays S3 and S&K separately, it's still hilarious how they initially advertised this collection with those 2 games in mind. Final release? You can't play them separately
• The new S3&K tracks. I... I don't know what sound chip Jun Senoue (same guy who composed S4EI) used but it sure wasn't a Mega Drive one. Tracks sound muffled, quiet and overall don't fit the stages. It's especially insulting to CNZ Act 2, its prototype track is EASILY one of my favorite Sonic tunes... and Jun completely butchered it. They should've asked Yuzo Koshiro to recompose them. But you wanna know THE coolest part? Origins is made on Criware (+ Denuvo), meaning the audio is encrypted, meaning it'll be really hard to mod music in. Just a neat thing, y'know :)
• Denuvo. No need to explain, you already know the game runs poorly. Countless stuttering too

PROS:
• Cutscenes look great, but what did you expect from Tyson Hesse and Powerhouse, you knew they'd pull it off with flying colors
• Classic games on PC so your usual ""I hope modders will fix it"" mentality will continue yet again! You expect SEGA to do all the work? Pfftt, yeah right

In the end you're left with:

Sonic 1 (Spin Dash is still present is so called Classic mode)
Sonic 2 (Tails' AI is from 2013 so it's still bad)
Sonic CD (They use leftover UI from the mobile version I kid you not)
and Sonic 3&K (with its muffled, MJ-free OST)

I grew up with the Genesis Games and I even have the damn strategy guide for Sonic 3 when it first came out. I was a huge Sonic Fan and I would still be if this series was just treated with the respect it deserves from its creators. Instead, once again, for the THOUSANDTH time since we've all started playing sonic. ""Just barely good enough"" is Sega's motto when it comes to these games.

The Good
-Widescreen
-Supposedly scales up to 4K, I have yet to even try that out
-Coins are a good incentive to travel throughout the whole game and grab as many rings as possible
-Super Sonic is Mapped to the Y Button like in Sonic Mania
-Tails Helper Controls are nearly perfect
-The camera controls seem to function better than the default controls in Sonic A.I.R, and you can now outrun the screen again. it's quite cool
-Ice Cap Act 1 and 2 and Launch Base Act 1 use their prototype music without many changes

...And the Bad

- The Music does not start or stop correctly in stages. Everything has a strange fade-in and fade-out effect.
- Special Stage Controls are tweaked, so if you're used to timing from S3/S3Air you will need to adjust
- For that matter it's sort of difficult to use the sound effects from the special stage as a reference point for when you need to turn because of how delayed they are
- The Special Stage music never speeds up as you play. So we went from S3 speed up too fast, S3K speeding up slower, and now S3K origins not speeding up at all... why?
- Many Sound effects are seemingly added in all over the place for no good reason, It makes some parts feel like I'm watching a flash/youtube fan movie
- Instead of letting you fruitlessly attack the first miniboss, they now arbitrarily lock you in place.
- The Super Sonic Music is absolutely terrible and I would've rather them played the invincibility theme if it was going to be this bad
- The Sonic 3 invincibility music is gone.. BUT they let you listen to it in museum mode for some crazy reason!
- Absolutely no gameplay customization options whatsoever as far as I can tell (not surprised...)
- Marble Garden's Crushers can now kill you from ALL SIDES rather than you needing to be under them... Ugh!
- Marble Garden's swinging spikeball hitboxes are bigger for some reason?
- A lot of things break really easily for the experienced players zipping through all the zones: Effects that are supposed to last for moments instead glitch out and last the entire level (For instance Marble Garden Zone when you first encounter the mini boss has debris falling and then it never stops if you run past it).
- Carnival Night Act 1 and 2 and Launch Base Act 2 music is god awful which is weird because the prototype music that was recently dug up would've been perfect to use. Either they used the wrong versions or Jun just plain out screwed up.

The worst offender of them all

-They list and let you listen to the ""unused music"" for sonic 3 in the museum mode, which the community has already agreed on being probably the prototype super sonic music, but Jun made his own track for the game that screams sonic 4 levels of bad and you cant. turn. it. OFF.

I'll update this as I go along but I really hope they fix the music up...

Edit: So supposedly the entire game is built up as a modification of Sonic Mania. That's interesting but what's REALLY screwed up is sega took these ports and forced them to run alongside the hedgehog engine that powers their 3D games. They hacked into the sound engine part of the Retro engine that powers the game and... absolutely butchered it.

So to break it down for you guys, and please leave a thumbs up if this makes sense...

Sega used their 3D game engine to replace the perfect sound that these games had to begin with on the retro engine... and on top of denuvo you are running a 3D game engine at the same time as these 2D engines. This isn't some sort of ""Haha technically..."" or ""Gotcha"".

Points 
- Illustrations are nice. A ton to look at and quite a bit of variety.  Sega teasing us with game gear sonic box arts. Include them! At least include Sonic 3D blast / Spinball. One of the islands is straight out of Spinball lol.  A lot of the illustrations already came on the Sonic the screensavers. Those 3 folks, including myself, that bought the original Sonic 3 and Knuckles way back in the windows 95 days.  So not much NEW but a lot of it is in a higher quality.  

- Music is a nice selection.  Sonic 3D blast, spinball AND chaotix is included as well. Why not the games though???? FUTURE DLC? Overall nice selection though.  I'm a bit eh about Sonic 3 music. But it is what it is. 

- Anniversary mode / Story mode / Mirror mode.  Just other ways to experience the sonic games. Can't complain.  Nice addition. I do like the extra cutscenes in the beginning of the games. It would have been nice to include more throughout the game.  But I'm not complaining with what we got. 

- Mission Mode.  I was expecting it to be a redundant last minute thought. Something similar to what the NES remix thing did. ""Here is first stage. Kill X amount of things / get amount of rings and reach the goal"" Instead it's either a specific section / modified level having me do specific things. Which I quite enjoyed. I am enjoying it WAY more than I was expecting it to.  Like, my only gripe is I wish there were MORE included. Mind you i've only done about 20% of it. BUT damn. They are fun.  I was expecting to do a few and get bored. But I'm actually enjoying Mission mode. Way more thought out than what I was expecting.  Way more fun as well.  I spent the first hour or so on mission mode alone.  I'm just surprised how much I'm enjoying them.

Sonic Origins is an overall fun experience.  Adds a bit extra for the fans, adds a lot to new comers.  My downsides? I mean give us 3D blast / spinball / chaotix / game gear games. Just more classic sonic content.  Been playing these games for ages now and I'm still enjoying them today.

627,117457968,english,"It's nowhere near as bad as some people make it out to be in their reviews but there are still some glaring issues.

The biggest one for me is the image quality, for some reason the games don't look very sharp. It almost looks like like they scaled the game up to 720p internally, then used interpolation for the rest. I'm not sure if this is what they did but it still doesn't look very great.

There's also a disgusting lack of customizability. When you play the game in anniversary/story mode you're forced to play with spin dash, drop dash, and infinite lives. Why can't we toggle these off? Why are all these settings are bundled together?

Drop dash is also another issue because it just feels... wrong. The way they implemented it feels rather inaccurate to Mania. This wouldn't be a huge issue to me normally because I don't even want to play these games with drop dash, but as I said we cannot really turn it off so... yeah...

And of course there's also the issue with the replaced music in Sonic 3. I love the original protoype tracks but these replacement tracks somehow manage to be much worse than those leaked proto tracks which is baffling.

Outside these issues this is a fantastic collection. Finally being be able to play these games in widescreen in an official fashion is a blessing, the option to retry special stages is awesome, the entire recreation of Sonic 3&K here is super well done, and the menus are rather pretty. I'm really enjoying the mission mode as well, though it isn't exactly mindblowing stuff. Same with the gallery I guess, there are some songs and concept art to unlock but it isn't going to hold your attention for too long.

And I mean, in the end, this is a collection if 3 fantastic games (and Sonic 1), it would be hard to completely hate it unless they messed up the games real bad.

I guess in the end I think the collection is good, just not $40 good. It's not as big of a disaster as Sonic Colors Ultimate that's for sure, I cannot believe they actually had the balls to release that mess.

641,117482369,english,"What should have been a smash-hit celebration of the greatest games of Sonic's history is instead a lackluster collection of ports that are universally worse than even the mobile versions. This is currently one of the worst ways to play Sonic 1-3 or Sonic CD.


- The game uses poor sprite scaling (likely linear/bilinear rather than integer) that makes the in-game graphics look blurrier than Mania or any of the mobile remasters. This does not appear to be a problem with any other platforms.

- The UI looks astonishingly blurry on high-resolution displays, as if it was created for a 720p  display and then stretched with, again, poor filtering.

- The sharp/smooth/CRT filtering options from previous releases have been completely removed.

- There is no way to play the games in the widescreen ""remastered"" mode with the original lives system. You're required to either use the new coins system that removes lives as a mechanic or play in a letterboxed square.

- The game does not obey Windows display scaling. Running in a borderless window will cause the game to take up a small chunk of the display.

- The game has vsync issues. I get screen tearing issues owing to the game locking to 59fps instead of 60fps.

- The music used for Sonic 3's Carnival Night, Ice Cap, and Launch Base zones are sharp downgrades from the prototype versions people thought we were getting. Sega directly stated these would use the original genesis soundchip, but they instead appear to be based on MIDI versions from the mid-90s PC collection. It's rough - Carnival Night in particular sounds like it's from a completely different system, terribly muffled/muddy and with a melody that's almost entirely absent due to poor mixing.

- Bugs that were present in the original release of Mania have found their way back in, including bad Tails pathfinding. There are lots of scenarios where Tails will end up stuck on springs off-screen, producing terrible noises.

- There are new and exciting physics bugs in Sonic 3 surrounding changing water levels and almost every stage gimmick.

- Drop Dash locks your direction in Sonic 1 and Sonic 2, and the way it interacts with slopes in those games makes it basically unusable.

- The DLC is a blatant cash grab, and would've just been cute add-ins for any other collection.

- The game's encrypted with Denuvo, so while some of this can be fixed by mods (like sound files), expecting anything deeper is a tall order. For the price, the community shouldn't be expected to fix the game's shortcomings.

I have a lot of other nitpicks (why are the options are tucked away in the Museum, why can you not change keyboard key binds, and why can you not move with the arrow keys?), but almost every one of these is a dealbreaker. This release is astonishingly buggy and rushed, and until/unless Sega addresses some of the many issues, this is just a worse way to play games you can already play just about anywhere else.

I feel like a lot of the additional features make up for it, 60 FPS, widescreen, Special Stage Restart, Autosave checkpoints, the mission modes are actually a ton of fun and remind me of those NES Remix packs for the Wii U.  If I was a kid playing this for the first time and coming off the Sonic 1 or 2 movie hype I'd be losing my mind!

Older fans like myself who are expecting this to be a 1:1 faithful recreation of everything they remember from their childhood to stay the same are going to be disappointed.  This does a great job at repackaging these older games for modern audiences, and for everything else there's Day 1 Mods.

651,117468543,english,"Hoo boy, where do I start. First, a bit of background info; like many people looking at this game, I have copies of all these games accross multiple platforms. So for me, if you're going to charge £37 I'm going to want something extra. For me, the mirror mode and missions were that, as well as a good, high quality definitive version of the game. £37 is steep, but justifiable, I guess.

Firstly, uh, I guess I have to talk about the DRM. For me it worked fine with no noticible lag, but I can't say that that it'll work for everyone. Or work forever. Or work when the servers get shut down. Why does this game need DRM, Sega? Almost everyone wanting to buy this game has a version of it on some other platform. Or a way to access the original if they wanted to pirate it. I'd forgive almost everything else if it wasn't for this dumb descision.

For the graphics, I'll reiterate what other people have mentioned about the ""fuzziness"". These games are low resolution, and so are displayed ""pixelated"". However, the way they've implemented the scaling of graphics means there's a blurry line that ""blends"" between the edges between two pixels, making them feel less crisp. If you have the game, you can notice it really easily by pausing the game; the pause menu looks much crisper than the game itself. This is a mistake that people working with pixel art should be aware of, and it's not a mistake that should be made here (""Integer Scaling"" is what you want here).

And yes, there is an option for anti-aliasing; that is turned off for me. Turning it on makes things much more blurry (which is what you want if you're looking for an authetic CRT look). Wait, why is there no option for fake scanlines like Mania had?

Anyway, the new content, which I justified the steeper price to myself for.

The mirror mode... I think that's on me, I was expecting something better. I was hoping it started the level at the ending signpost, and you ran through the level backwards. Instead, it's just mirroring the screen so everything goes right to left. It's still cool and interesting, but not worth £37. Shouldn't be that hard to implement in an emulator either; just flip the display before rendering it.

The mission mode is lackluster. I was expecting more for £37. For each game in the collection, you get 15 missions (18 if you spend more money! Or preorder? I forget which). Each mission is less than a minute long and is some arbitary challange that you do, and its super easy to get an S. I would have like to have seen maybe 5 challanges per zone? I was hoping for some custom level edits (beyond what they've done by adding cubes and badniks to the existing levels). Or even something as simple as ""beat the entire level in 1:30"", or without getting hurt.

Spending money on a remake in the new engine of the old Sonic games is something I'm perfectly willing to do... Just not £37 on a subpar, DRM ridden cash grab. My condolonces to the people working on the game who genuinely wanted it to be a good, authentic remake.

One last thing... When playing the game, the mouse is not hidden and always visible. Come on Sega, why would you think that that's okay?

the title screen looks nice, and gives you a good first impression
But the games. Ohhh the games.
first of all, in anniversary mode you're FORCED to get coins instead of lives. why is lives tied to classic mode? that's stupid. what if you wanna play with lives but with the 16:9 aspect ratio? i guess you're just screwed then!
not to mention you only have to pay one coin to retry a special stage. you can just stock up on coins super easily and get infinite retries?? 100 rings gives you 1 single coin, similar to lives. why? i dont know! it's stupid
second of all, the bugs. ohhh my lord the bugs.
it just never ends. collision errors, softlocks, you name it. if you can give it a name, this game probably has it. did anybody even playtest this?
sometimes a basic function like THE DROP DASH doesn't work. i've seen clips of people dropdashing, getting hit, and still getting the boost when they hit the ground.
i saw someone beat ice cap act 2's boss without even starting it.
i saw someone wrong warp from mushroom hill all the way to hidden palace in sonic 3.
the audio is super muffled in the games for whatever reason, not to mention sonic 3's new tracks.
the new tracks are incredibly scuffed versions of the prototype tracks. the proto versions sounded fine. why not just use those?
super sonic's theme in sonic 3 sounds like it was taken straight from sonic 4. how do you screw this up so bad?
theres also no knuckles in sonic cd. he's in every other game! why not sonic cd? i don't know. i can't even think of a valid reason.
overall, i believe the game is a buggy piece of shitassery that shouldn't be purchased in it's current state.

Except for the Music in 3&k had to be replaced *for obvious reasons*. It is disappointing to see they took just about all the other versions of these games down to release this. I don't know for sure why. 

The DLC/Deluxe edition don't really add much. It's basically just new unlockables. The music DLC literally just lets you unlock the Remixes from other games to play them through the In-game music player. The Fun Pack just adds unlockable behind the scenes stuff. Animatics and stuff. Hard Missions are also apart of the DLC but I have yet to get to playing them. 

The content that is added to the collection are super nice and all, but like... theres really only like 3 or 4 notable things. 

Each game now has a new Into and Outro animation. I absolutely adore all of them! they also kept in the CD into and outro and even went out of their way to make them as HD as possible! 

Coins replace Lives in Anniversary mode. So now Death just kinda means you have to start the level over. Coins are used to unlock things in the museum and retry Special Stages. Super welcome addition! Classic mode is still here...-ish? It basically just reduces the screen to it's original format and brings back lives. But it doesn't seem to remove parts of Sonic's Moveset that might've been in the original games. There's really not much reason to play these. 

Drop Dash is now apart of Classic Sonic's moveset! All I can say is these levels were absolutely not designed around it. Metal Sonic is too easy to beat with it. Spindash is available in Sonic 1, which is absolutely busted. and you have the option to use either the CD or Sonic 2 spindash in CD. You can also still chose what soundtrack you want to use in CD. 


Right now, this *is* the definitive way to play these games, and I would recommend it. But Jesus the 3D island really reduces who can play this game on PC... 
there should've at least been an option to toggle the 3D stuff. 
$40USD is very debatable. I'm very mixed on recommending this just on Price alone. 

If you just want to play these games in HD and 60fps, and Not on your phone, than here you are. But the $40 pricetag really is too high for this imo. maybe $30 or $25 would've been a lot more reasonable. I wonder if we'll even be able to mod this game...

Idk, I enjoy these games, and I already have beaten both 1 and CD, so I can't really refund at this point. I'll try to find more to do in this game.

Sure, there's more content here than 3D All-Stars, but the ""extra modes"" are just bite-sized generic missions.

And let's just get this out of the way. The new tracks for S3&K are some of the worst music I've heard from these games. I understand they couldn't use the originals but did they really have to be this awful? They don't fit the levels, and aren't even memorable.

Also, minor nitpicking here but Sonic CD's default soundtrack is the US one, which is objectively worse than the JP one. So that's cool. Also, weirdly enough, the option to change the soundtrack is in the game itself, not the collection menu. Just an odd choice, it doesn't bother me that much but it's a talking point nonetheless.

 [*]Some minor bugs in a couple of stages.

CONS that probably won't be fixed:
[list]
    [*]No options on what abilities you want for each game. You get the spin dash and drop dash + whatever abilities are native to the game. While modders will probably make it possible, the fact that you can't simply toggle which one you want is silly.
 [*] Specifically made cutscenes aside, this collection doesn't offer any new or behind the scenes stuff that wasn't already made available before.
[*] While new features like playable knuckles in S1 or spin dash in S1 are nice, it's all stuff that was already seen in rom hacks years ago. Missed opportunity to really show something new and unique.

679,117496807,english,"This is simultaneously the best and most disappointing collection for the classic era of Sonic games.
While the games are built from the ground up using the Retro Engine, the lack of content is really disheartening. Sonic Mega Collection Plus has twenty games and a treasure trove of gallery content, while also coming out nearly 20 years ago. I'll admit the galley content in Origins IS really cool for long-time fans, but there could be so much more.

As for the games themselves...
Sonic 1 was perfect, all things considered. After a few dozen re-releases, I think this is the definitive way to play the original game. The ability to retry Special Stages (which is included in every game) is especially helpful for Sonic 1. Overall: a perfect port for a perfect game.
Sonic 2, as well, had almost no faults. The biggest issue is Tails's AI, which seems to stay stuck for well over half the stage before realizing he's making your ears bleed and warping back to you (I've learned forcing him to fly helps when this happens). Everything from the iOS/Android remaster is here and accounted for, and I'm glad to see this finally officially available on PC and Consoles. Another (near) perfect way to play this masterpiece.
Sonic CD is virtually just the 2011 remaster, with the inclusion of the lyrics in the opening and ending for the JP/EU Soundtrack (Toot-Toot, Sonic Warrior!) While my opinions on this game go back and forth as much as this game's level design, I can't deny that this is a solid entry in the series and deserves to be checked out by any Sonic fan. Another flawless port.

And then we get to Sonic 3 & Knuckles... Where do I begin?
This is like the ""George Lucas Special Editions"" of the Sonic series. There's a lot of small additions to this game that range from quality of life (Super Sonic sprites touched up, better rotation effects) to downright baffling (random sound effect additions or changes that don't alter the experience, but felt unnecessary). Then there's the whole music fiasco. Blah-Blah-Blah, Carnival Night, Ice Cap and Launch Base all have different tunes. But nobody decided to tell me that they made a new song for Super Sonic's Transformation? It's not amazing, but it's better than the Invincibility Theme. Then during the final cutscene there's yet another random new song? Not terrible, in fact I'd say it's an improvement, but why? Just so many weird things about this remaster that makes no sense after playing the original (and AIR) for years. Another point on the audio: some SFX and BGM sound muffled / compressed, like Knuckles' Theme. It comes off very rushed and that they didn't put that much time to have the same level of quality the other 3 games have in their ports.

Mission Mode is fun, for the most part. Some of the later difficulty Missions get downright frustrating (looking at you Sky Chase Zone levels) and the Extreme Difficulty ones aren't much to write home about.

OH YEAH, there's the whole DLC debacle. There is literally no reason any of the DLC should have been DLC. This should've either been included in the base game or been in a free update in the future. Making it an extra $5 is such a pointless cash-grab that I, admittedly, fell for and I'm here to warn others to not be as stupid as me who fell for it because I'm such a fan of this franchise.

TLDR
Sonic Origins is an all-around competent collection of the Blue Blur's first four platforming adventures on the Genesis. While the changes to Sonic 3 will make old fans VERY disappointed, let's all be happy we're on PC, right? ;-)
While PC players have many other options to play these games, I'd say the bonus content (especially the cutscenes) make this experience worth it for long-time fans and newcomers that've viewed this series from a distance for some time and want a good point to jump in with the Classic Era.",1656049602,1656049602,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198100519288,400,13,637,637,637,1656046775,1794960.0
680,117492856,english,"I'm going to write this review primarily about the Sonic 3 & Knuckles component of Origins, since that's where all my time went.

I'm not sure what to say for this one. I've been pretty hyped for Origins, since S3&K is genuinely one of my favorite retro titles and we haven't seen any kind of re-release for it in some time. Unfortunately it seems like we didn't actually get that, and instead we ended up getting something dancing around trying to pretend it's S3&K. As someone who plays through the original on a very regular basis, this port just feels *off*. 

Sonic does NOT handle smoothly. You seem to stick to some surfaces, mid-air control is nonexistent, some surfaces will send you flying at weird angles, and some gaps will be ""fine"" one second and then randomly crush you the next. The original genesis Sonic titles were always about fast paced gameplay with extremely tight controls and it feels like NONE of that transitioned over. There seems to be an inconsistent input latency layered on top of everything, as some times Sonic would wait before responding to my jump, while other times I had to purposefully slow down my input of spin dashing because the game would arbitrarily decide to respond to the jump button BEFORE the fact that i was holding down.

Maybe the included versions of Sonic 1 / 2 / CD are great (since they use the pre-existing mobile ports), but the attempt at S3&K most certainly is not. I could forgive the $40 pricetag for yet another re-release, the lack of original licensed music, the use of Denuvo, or even the blatant cash grab DLC; But somehow Sega took a nigh perfect game, and found a way to drain the fun out of it.

The two biggest points of contention here (three if you count Denuvo, ugh) are the replaced music tracks in Sonic 3 and the $40 price tag. The new music is... complete garbage, to put it gently. Both the final and prototype versions of the music are way better than this, and thankfully it's easy to mod either of them back into this game! It feels like a bad stain on an otherwise perfect remaster of one of the best games of all time, so I'd definitely recommend modding it before you play.

695,117464014,english,"Considering all those negative reviews I have to say that it runs flawlessly on my rig (i5 10600, RTX 3070, 16 GBRAM). 

Sonic Origins is a good collection of 4 classic Sonic titles - Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 and Sonic CD. There is story mode allowing to play through all those games as if one single coherent experience, then there is boss rush mode and anniversary mode for all the games. There are online rankings which nobody really cares about and an in-built music player. Many bonuses are locked behind a ""paywall"" in the form of special coins you have to earn via playing in order to unlock many bonuses. There is a lot of nice animated cutscenes as if it´s an old animation movie.

If you are a fan of Sonic then ...what?!! 40 EUR?!! No way... No, it is too much even if it means 1 game for 10 EUR. It´s just these game are so old that I cannot recommend it for thise price. For, let´s say [strike]20 bucks[/strike]... no, for 15 bucks it will be an awesome buying.

Since my personal review policies never took prices into account (because nevertheless a game costs 50 bucks or 5 bucks, it is still just the same game with the same gameplay), I recommend this collection because the games are just good. The price is not that good tho...

Yeah, Capcom. A full mouse support for browsing the menus would be welcomed. The game has just a lazy mouse support, not ideal at all.

Also bear in mind that I am not a Sonic fanboy so I may never tell differencies (if there are some) in sounds or music or even graphics between this version and the original versions. I am not any competent player for such a detailed info. My review just says that the games work, there are some additional elements and the games run with no slowdowns (the emulation seems to be fine).",1655999865,1656000152,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,True,False,76561198024738734,233,100,26,26,26,1655999099,1794960.0

Some initial thoughts on the game on launch day (6/23) with a couple hours played.

- New cutscenes are BEAUTIFUL. Powerhouse Team did an incredible job with these cutscenes, and they put a lot of love into them.

- Sonic 1 and 2 are ports of the mobile version, with drop dash lazily added into it. Drop dash causes some issues in both games (controls are locked in a rolling jump). Gameplay is essentially the same as it was in the mobile ports otherwise, which was pretty good. 

- Sonic CD is the same as the 2011 release, reusing most of the same menus from it. The soundtrack options are in the actual Sonic CD game so in order to change the soundtrack you have to actually go into the game from Anniversary or Classic mode to do so (there's no option to change it from the Story mode). Being that it is a re-release of the 2011 version this also means that Knuckles isn't playable in it, which is rather disappointing. 

- S3K is probably where the most issues are. Music quality sounds really bad and graphically it doesn't look anywhere near as good as the other three games. Some of the physics seem a bit.. off, more than in 1, 2 or CD. AIR probably spoiled a lot of us with how many features and all of the customization it has, but this ""remaster"" is just nowhere near the same quality. Pretty disappointed here.

- The museum mode is neat but there are a lot of incorrectly labeled songs in it (this is mostly part of the deluxe version but it's worth noting in here). Door Into Summer is the wrong song completely (and RIP because it's a banger) and some songs within Sonic Spinball are incorrect. Song quality is also really inconsistent. If you're going to make people pay more for the deluxe version of the game, at least give people the highest quality (and actually get the stuff right lmao).

- Additional modes are cool. Mission mode has a lot of neat challenges, mirror mode is a fun twist to play all the stages backwards, and boss rush is.. well, boss rush. Not worth the price, but they're a fun addition.

- No online multiplayer for S2 or S3. Seriously?

I am really excited to see what the community does with this game via modding but [b] for right now I can't really recommend the game at its current price [/b]. The additional mission mode and the museum are not enough content to justify the price of the game, especially with as many issues as there are with it. Otherwise, I hope we get a patch to fix some of these issues soon (but SEGA track record on these fixes is pretty bad, just thinking back to Colors Ultimate).

Switching to my GPU totally fixed it so I thought that was worth mentioning if anyone else is having trouble making the game run well!

This is the definitive way to experience the classic Sonic games, aside from a few minor nitpicks, and the drop-dash definitely makes the games so much easier and fun to play! I'm also really glad they removed lives and added coins instead since I'm pretty bad at the classic games lmao. Outside of the issues I mentioned before, the game runs flawlessly with no frame drops or lag. My biggest issue is with the key-bindings which are absolutely terrible and for some reason, it wouldn't let me change them to how I wanted them. Fortunately, the game is much better controlled with an Xbox controller so I won't be using the keyboard much. Some of the Sonic 3&K music is also vastly inferior due to it being a recreation of the prototype tracks, but the prototype tracks somehow sound so much more finished than the versions used in Origins.

699,117458589,english,"TLDR: forced filtering and jacked-up performance, seemingly an fps/refresh mismatch that causes severe game-ruining stutter if you don't have a VRR display

All I really wanted from this collection was to finally be able to play Sonic 3 & Knuckles in 16:9... when I woke up this morning and gamers weren't rejoicing in the streets I had my suspicions, and reading the reviews on Steam gave me more cause for concern, but I smuggly assumed that those losers had failed to turn off a filter or put the resolution wrong or something; they aren't smart & cool like me so they don't get to hang out with Sonic the Hedgehog(TM) and his furry (non-sexual) friends.

So imagine my shock when it turned out that the mad lads at Sega managed to fuck up! Haha, whoa, that doesn't usually happen! What did they do? Forced filtering.

https://u.cubeupload.com/arekkusu/202206231346361.jpg - Sonic Origins S3&K
https://u.cubeupload.com/arekkusu/202206231345061.jpg - emulated S3&K no filter
https://u.cubeupload.com/arekkusu/202206231418211.jpg - emulated S3&K w/ bilinear filtering

(The only option for a filter is this ""anti-aliasing"" filter, which was disabled in previous screenshots: 
https://u.cubeupload.com/arekkusu/202206231404291.jpg Obviously, this filter is dog shit and should be avoided.)

The way that pixels are blurred together and the general unfocussed look of the image seem similar to the emulated game with bilinear enabled, but not quite as bad. The pixels themselves look fine, I don't think the sprite is badly scaled and I can't see any long pixels or anything weird, it's just filtered in this undesirable way. I do think that if this fix this, it'll look quite good.

Other than the widescreen and the forced filter, nothing has really been done to S3&K. The game has what could be perceived as stutter due to the way that Sonic stops for a frame when you (for one example) jump and that's something I would probably have changed if I was charging £36 for this. I feel like perhaps there are other stutters here too. For some reason, the VRR readout on my TV fluctuates between ~57–59 while playing— wait hold on I should test this...

HAHAHAHAHAHAH it's completely fucked with VRR turned off! I tested Sonic 1 like this, and experienced constant stuttering that made the game unplayable. Sonic CD was better, settling instead for one biiiiig stutter every few seconds instead. Fantastic work, guys. 

Don't buy this. They need to fix the performance and they need to give us the option for nice clean pixels.

A couple of smaller complaints:

- the animations are cool but how tf do you make a cool OP and then not slap some cheesy vocals on there? With Sonic CD in here it feels incongruous.

- new UI elements that appear in the game are much higher-res than the game and look bad as a result.

edit: I didn't realise before, but the anti-aliasing filter in the game is almost a 1:1 match with how the emulated game looks with bilinear filtering.

I am a huge Sonic fan. Sonic 3 & Knuckles is still to this day my favourite game of all time. It is hard to give any new comer a proper description of how good atleast this one title in the collection of four really is. We have made almost 30 years of progress in game design but the game still holds up well. I would probably not recommend it to anyone who is not a sonic fan and as such there probably is also no need to even recommend it as sonic fans will or will eventually buy the game. 

Currently many might feel it is over priced, nothing a special wouldnt fix. What is the fair value? That is up to the buyer.

There are a few improvements for S3&K. Sonic now has more subtle animations when it comes to his rotation on the barrels in carnival night zone, probably added due to more storage. Super Sonic also benefits from this as his animations has also been fleshed out such as the rotation on the hydrocity lifts. Flashing sprites are replaced with transparent ones and special stages feels extra smooth.

There are noticable flaws in the game. Physics are largely the same but swings in angle island swings you through spikes, the hydrocity air jets pushes you up making it impossible to get a specific 1-up. The special stage at the end of act 2 is unreachable because of the increased frame rate not allowing you to properly clip up the ledge. The large offence is the one everyone has heard about. The Jackson music is missing from Carnival Night, Ice Cap and Launchbase instead replaced by the pc midi and original proto type music. 

Not speaking of the package as a whole but with a few patches the bugs can be fixed. Sadly the music can't. Other than that I welcome the changes.",1656009845,1656009845,True,2,0,0.518248140811920166,0,True,False,False,76561197970773758,558,47,245,245,140,1656019674,1794960.0

This has to be the worst way to play these games on PC so far. 

The stuttering problem, The horrible optimisation, the weird audio mixing, The Sonic 3 Sound track being replaced with a very bad version of the prototype music (The prototype Soundtrack was not bad, the ORIGIN'S remix of the tracks are.) and much much more. 

Remember, The IOS games are Free right now and you can connect a BlueTooth Controller to play 1, 2 & CD. CD is also on the Steam store with a very well made version might I add. And Sonic 3 A.I.R is the best way to play sonic 3 Right now. 

This is the worst way to make a collection, And this is saying alot since sonic had some of the best collections known to Gamecube and PS2. 

Get the game for the Cutscenes. They are amazing. Anything else, Just get the other versions. 

If you Like this game, Good on ya, Its still a good idea to try out the others tho, Im sure most of the problems with the stuttering and optimisation Is because of Denuvo, SEGA has it on around launch in their games because they are scared people would Pirate it around the launch window and that is where they get the most sales.

I would say that other than that, the games themselves are great. Since these are the 4 classic titles, these would be pretty fun experience and would be the definitive way to play them if SEGA will fix these issues

It's not anything mind-blowing, but fans will appreciate the new cutscenes and extra presentation and gameplay gubbins. Finally having some way to play Sonic 1 and 2 on something besides mobile (officially anyway) is very good, not to mention having Sonic 3&K playable in widescreen at all. Mission mode is a neat little diversion, story mode seems like a good way to just blitz through all the games in one string, the new Blue Spheres levels are fun if you're into that, and the museum is a nice bonus. 

I also appreciate the new coins system, as it makes playing special stages less of a headache. For purists, they will like that the original versions are included for preservation's sake (though no way to play Sonic 3 and S&K separately? Bit of a nitpick, but if you're going to include the original roms, might as well add that extra bit, yes?). A lot of people may balk at the ""new"" music in S3&K, but I enjoy these beta tracks and I'm glad that their existence allows Sega to re-release the game finally. Music is subjective, yadda-yadda

Denuvo sucks but doesn't impact gameplay, and the DLC and pre-order nickle-and-diming sucks but ultimately doesn't take that much away from the core experience. Depending on your priorities, one might also find these games to be too old for the price tag, though I personally think the price was just fine for what I got (four not-unsizeable games with updated presentation and gameplay and a variety of side challenges).

The only thing I enjoyed from these ports is the animated cutscenes, being able to replay the special stages if you fail them and the addition of the drop dash from Mania. Everything else is just the original classics, even in the anniversary mode. Which has these coins instead of lives.

I know I will anger some people but I literally grew up in the modern era of Sonic. Here's my refund message for context:
""If Christian Whitehead helped with this game, I could give it a pass but honestly, even then, playing the original sonic games is a task for me.

If you seriously want to play the classic 4 games, the mobile ports of the original 4 games are, unironically, the wave to go since Mr. Whitehead himself helped with them but as for me, I'll just play some other games.""

If you grew up with the classic games, I guess you can give this a shot. For now, I'd rather just play Mania..",1655983230,1655983230,False,10,0,0.506234407424926758,0,True,False,False,76561198160895740,71,3,91,91,91,1655982234,1794960.0
765,117494099,english,"Oh god what a let down this was.

So first off, the game ran HORRIBLY, mainly suffering ALOT of slowdown whenever the game saved, started a level, came off from the main menu or entering a Special Stage; majority of the time pausing and unpausing would fix the slowdown but around Lava Reef in S3&K the slowdown would happen way more often, maybe it was because of Hyper Sonic? Honestly majority of these issues seem more than likely caused by Denuvo DRM, which from last time it was used in a Classic Sonic title (Sonic Mania) it ran horribly. So I was wishing they'd had some hindsight.

The controls in Sonic 1, CD and 2 are all messed up. Main example being that the drop dash is implemented in a way where when you land you don't do the dash immediately and instead it keeps you vulnerable for a frame before doing a SHORT spindash. Alongside this when rolling your controls are locked to just jumping, you are incapable of doing ANY course correction or even changing the direction you're dashing with the Drop Dash.

During Sonic CD specifically the sound effects are all sorts of messed up, what comes to mind first for it being the air timer and drowning being pitched up and out of sync. The goal post spinning and other sound effects also end up sounding like they're played through a botched emulator, maybe even an AtGames Mega Drive.

In Sonic 3 & Knuckles, the most promising of the games in this batch, the music and sound effects sound really muffled or compressed at times, and the new remixes of the Prototype tracks are flat and out of key at points. And don't get me started on the special stages, I had gotten all 7 Chaos Emeralds by Marble Garden ACT 1, during which I was able to transform into Super Sonic fine. By ACT 2 my Chaos Emeralds had reset to 1 for some reason, in which I had to get all of them AGAIN. And even after that touching a Giant Ring would make me repeat the seventh Blue Spheres stage instead of giving me 50 rings, despite me already having the emeralds. This problem was fixed by Mushroom Hill ACT 1 though due to how the Super Emeralds work. Speaking of the Super Emeralds, using Hyper Sonic is a nightmare. So they never removed his rapidly flashing colour palette or screen clearing flash of white, infact they only made the screen flash worse by adding a hyper quick fade in/out.

These experiences were all from one marathon of the Story Mode, and while the new cutscenes and visual additions to S3&K were great and fun, the problems listed above were enough to make my favourite games a miserable experience.

Overall this is a pretty bad collection and remaster, bringing bugs and issues to already perfected versions of Sonic 1, CD and 2 (Mobile, IOS/Android) and a decent but buggy remaster of Sonic 3 & Knuckles, which supposedly according to Stealth from Headcannon on Twitter, is not what they handed SEGA fully.

If I was to recommend this it'd be hopefully after the game gets patched, as I can see this becoming my main way to play these games if the launch wasn't botched.
Instead I'd recommend the Mobile ports of these games and maybe emulating Sonic 3, I would recommend them all from steam but SEGA removed being able to buy the Mega Drive versions of these games a month or two ago to make way for this.

Play Sonic 1 Forever, Sonic 2 Absolute, Sonic CD decompilled and Sonic 3 Angel Island Revisited if you want a PC widescreen Sonic experience, all of these require dumps of the payed versions of the games from mobile and a rom back up of Sonic 3, methods for obtaining a rom I cannot give as SEGA's official version of Sonic 3 & Knuckles no longer exists here, which S3AIR used.",1656044814,1656044814,False,2,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False,76561198137949242,71,4,757,757,757,1656043590,1794960.0

all mainline 2D sonic games in one package(excluding mania)

Sonic 3 and knuckles remade from the ground up in 16:9 

cool new animations tying all the games together perfectly

new challenge mode/ unlock-able things(pictures,music ect)

lyrical versions of ""you can do anything"" and ""cosmic eternity"" are now back in sonic CD

Mirror Mode

its 2D sonic so if you like that then this is beautiful

Cons
Price tag may be to high for some

Horrible DLC(can you even call that dlc why wasn't it just in the game already?)

because of the whole MJ copyright stuff wirh sonic 3 some songs had to be taken out and were replaced with horrible midi tracks instead of the beta genesis tracks(dunno why)

the audio is a bit off(not sure where they got the audio from but from time to time it can sound glitchy and very low quality)

considering that these are the whitehead ports the games look somewhat blury and not pixel perfect

very little customization with each game (think of something like sonic 3 air, sonic 1 forever, or sonic 2 complete. those were all fan remakes for pc that had a whole slew of things you can change about each games so they'd be just right for you.....now think of this where there are barely any changes you can make to the games which is kinda a letdown)

thats all the cons I could find now since I'm only 4 hours in

So uh yea I think this is a pretty good package. the price may be high for some so if that's true for you then wait until it goes on sale in like....what a couple of months?

The next problem is the music (but not with replacement music S3&K because Michael Jackson lawsuit)

- The Music and SFX was not balance, even the something was missing SFX from previous Mobile version

- The music was really low quality, even hard to hear the BGM because not balance with the SFX

The Control

OMG this is F*cked and clunky delay as hell, I thought my PS4 Controller was got an issue. But while I'm using the keyboard, the delay still there.

And I check my PS4 Controller again and play it on my Mobile version Sonic 1, it's great as it is.

DeNuvo issue

GOD, DID EVEN SEGA STILL HEARING US?!!!!

Look, this DRM made some problem with my PC, here's the list problem Sonic Games with DeNuvo

- Sonic Mania, need always ONLINE mode. (Fortunatelly this was removed and reduce the file size)
- Sonic Forces (stuttering issue because this DRM, even with high specs)
- Sonic Colors Ultimate on Epic Games (Same with Forces, but worse because broken f*cking game, hopefully if Sega see this, they consider it to removed this on Steam version later)

580.000 IDR a.k.a 45 USD for broken deluxe game, I don't know man.....

CONS:

Denuvo (Let's punish people who actually want to play the game and at the same time make it easier instead of more difficult for people to pirate!) I'm going to say it now as is for some other people, it runs on extremely low frames. (Personally on my end, it ran a solid 1-12 frames per second, Thanks Denuvo, for the stuttering!)

Music. (For once, a sonic game that doesn't have at least decent music!?)
Maybe it's just me and I'm crazy for thinking so, but I honestly do not find interest in some of the music. I understand the removal of some tracks considering the whole MJ situation, and that's completely fine. What isn't fine in my eyes is removing music that wasn't even connected to MJ himself. (I'm of course talking about ever so infamous Ice Cap Zone, which more closely resembles the song ""Hard Times"" by The Jetzons.)

No custom keybindings (You want to use A to jump? Sorry, none of that here.)

CONS:
• Most important - NO integer scaling, meaning all 4 games look just as blurry as Sonic CD 2011. What was the point of finally releasing the 2013 remasters on consoles if they look worse than when they did on mobile?
• Mission Mode is comprised of bite-sized, generically-designed levels that would make the most amateur platformers blush. I could tell it was made by Sonic Team cuz the mode features grey X-blocks like Forces and they're EVERYWHERE with no slopes in sight
• Amy/Knuckles isn't playable in CD (a primarily exploration-themed game), and don't get me started on Amy - a character that's been promoted since the Archie Mega Drive days as part of Team Sonic. Then in Mania Adventures, then in IDW comics. So you'd think they would finally make her playable? Lol, you want them to make a new sprite-sheet? You're asking for too much
• No basic customizations. After all these years, after fan projects like S3 Complete or AIR, our boys at SEGA couldn't be bothered to add the most basic options between all 4 games like hackers/modders do. No peel-out in S3, no elemental shields in S1/CD/2, no insta-shield in CD, no Jam difficulties, no option to use lives/timeouts in Anniversary Mode or collect Tokens in Classic Mode, etc.
• Island Tour DLC just allows you to zoom-in on each island, not even rotate them. Money well spent. And that ""animated characters on island"" DLC? All of them are ripped from Gens/Forces :)
• The """"""Drop Dash"""""" is a pure lie. What do I mean? It's actually a disguised Spin Dash animation that happens for a split-second? Doesn't sound bad, except the AGES version of S1/S2 natively added it to their ROMs. Oh! And in Origins it BARELY moves you after you execute it. Best part? S1/S2 have a fixed jump arc, so if you try to do this move in those games and jump, you won't be able to control yourself mid-air (think Castlevania)
• The Museum... oh my god, remember those so-called ""never-before seen concept arts"" they promised? Well I'm here to tell you there are like 6 of them, everything else are Harmony covers and character sheets. The Video section has none of those cool 90s ads, promo videos or even documentaries, just a few pieces of the Sonic Symphony they threw in at the last hour, Origins' cutscenes and every episode of Mania Adventures (and their respective animatics). Both Normal and Premium sections offer very little content, especially if you pre-ordered the game which gives you a 100 Token bonus, you can literally unlock everything in under 2 hours. Not to mention it's complete silence, no remix of History or anything like that, no feeling of nostalgia. Just cynical, corporate silence as you browse what little stuff they offer. Only """"""new"""""" track here is a remix of Sonic World from Jam that plays everywhere except the Museum. Classy
• S1/2/CD are straight mobile versions, so they haven't been touched up at all. Meaning the missing rolling SFX in CD hasn't been fixed, and the extended camera is still absent
• Horrible audio quality. Believe it or not, they used the remastered OSTs for S1, CD and S2 from mobile. Sounds good? There are just 2 tiiiiiny problems: S3&K, y'know... the only new thing here, isn't given the same treatment so its OST is really muffled, and ON TOP OF THAT, CD's 2 OSTs are super quiet and also in bad quality. How did they screw it up? idk, but it is hilarious 
• The music DLC (Chaotix, 3D Blast and Spinball) misnamed countless tracks, so for example; the bad ending theme of Chaotix (Destructive Power) is Door to Summer while the Invincibility theme in 3D Blast is the Menu theme. Incompetent? Very much. Funny? Absolutely
• Even though I'm not one of those people that plays S3 and S&K separately, it's still hilarious how they initially advertised this collection with those 2 games in mind. Final release? You can't play them separately
• The new S3&K tracks. I... I don't know what sound chip Jun Senoue (same guy who composed S4EI) used but it sure wasn't a Mega Drive one. Tracks sound muffled, quiet and overall don't fit the stages. It's especially insulting to CNZ Act 2, its prototype track is EASILY one of my favorite Sonic tunes... and Jun completely butchered it. They should've asked Yuzo Koshiro to recompose them. But you wanna know THE coolest part? Origins is made on Criware (+ Denuvo), meaning the audio is encrypted, meaning it'll be really hard to mod music in. Just a neat thing, y'know :)
• Denuvo. No need to explain, you already know the game runs poorly. Countless stuttering too

PROS:
• Cutscenes look great, but what did you expect from Tyson Hesse and Powerhouse, you knew they'd pull it off with flying colors
• Classic games on PC so your usual ""I hope modders will fix it"" mentality will continue yet again! You expect SEGA to do all the work? Pfftt, yeah right

In the end you're left with:

Sonic 1 (Spin Dash is still present is so called Classic mode)
Sonic 2 (Tails' AI is from 2013 so it's still bad)
Sonic CD (They use leftover UI from the mobile version I kid you not)
and Sonic 3&K (with its muffled, MJ-free OST)

I grew up with the Genesis Games and I even have the damn strategy guide for Sonic 3 when it first came out. I was a huge Sonic Fan and I would still be if this series was just treated with the respect it deserves from its creators. Instead, once again, for the THOUSANDTH time since we've all started playing sonic. ""Just barely good enough"" is Sega's motto when it comes to these games.

The Good
-Widescreen
-Supposedly scales up to 4K, I have yet to even try that out
-Coins are a good incentive to travel throughout the whole game and grab as many rings as possible
-Super Sonic is Mapped to the Y Button like in Sonic Mania
-Tails Helper Controls are nearly perfect
-The camera controls seem to function better than the default controls in Sonic A.I.R, and you can now outrun the screen again. it's quite cool
-Ice Cap Act 1 and 2 and Launch Base Act 1 use their prototype music without many changes

...And the Bad

- The Music does not start or stop correctly in stages. Everything has a strange fade-in and fade-out effect.
- Special Stage Controls are tweaked, so if you're used to timing from S3/S3Air you will need to adjust
- For that matter it's sort of difficult to use the sound effects from the special stage as a reference point for when you need to turn because of how delayed they are
- The Special Stage music never speeds up as you play. So we went from S3 speed up too fast, S3K speeding up slower, and now S3K origins not speeding up at all... why?
- Many Sound effects are seemingly added in all over the place for no good reason, It makes some parts feel like I'm watching a flash/youtube fan movie
- Instead of letting you fruitlessly attack the first miniboss, they now arbitrarily lock you in place.
- The Super Sonic Music is absolutely terrible and I would've rather them played the invincibility theme if it was going to be this bad
- The Sonic 3 invincibility music is gone.. BUT they let you listen to it in museum mode for some crazy reason!
- Absolutely no gameplay customization options whatsoever as far as I can tell (not surprised...)
- Marble Garden's Crushers can now kill you from ALL SIDES rather than you needing to be under them... Ugh!
- Marble Garden's swinging spikeball hitboxes are bigger for some reason?
- A lot of things break really easily for the experienced players zipping through all the zones: Effects that are supposed to last for moments instead glitch out and last the entire level (For instance Marble Garden Zone when you first encounter the mini boss has debris falling and then it never stops if you run past it).
- Carnival Night Act 1 and 2 and Launch Base Act 2 music is god awful which is weird because the prototype music that was recently dug up would've been perfect to use. Either they used the wrong versions or Jun just plain out screwed up.

The worst offender of them all

-They list and let you listen to the ""unused music"" for sonic 3 in the museum mode, which the community has already agreed on being probably the prototype super sonic music, but Jun made his own track for the game that screams sonic 4 levels of bad and you cant. turn. it. OFF.

I'll update this as I go along but I really hope they fix the music up...

Edit: So supposedly the entire game is built up as a modification of Sonic Mania. That's interesting but what's REALLY screwed up is sega took these ports and forced them to run alongside the hedgehog engine that powers their 3D games. They hacked into the sound engine part of the Retro engine that powers the game and... absolutely butchered it.

So to break it down for you guys, and please leave a thumbs up if this makes sense...

Sega used their 3D game engine to replace the perfect sound that these games had to begin with on the retro engine... and on top of denuvo you are running a 3D game engine at the same time as these 2D engines.

Points 
- Illustrations are nice. A ton to look at and quite a bit of variety.  Sega teasing us with game gear sonic box arts. Include them! At least include Sonic 3D blast / Spinball. One of the islands is straight out of Spinball lol.  A lot of the illustrations already came on the Sonic the screensavers. Those 3 folks, including myself, that bought the original Sonic 3 and Knuckles way back in the windows 95 days.  So not much NEW but a lot of it is in a higher quality.  

- Music is a nice selection.  Sonic 3D blast, spinball AND chaotix is included as well. Why not the games though???? FUTURE DLC? Overall nice selection though.  I'm a bit eh about Sonic 3 music. But it is what it is. 

- Anniversary mode / Story mode / Mirror mode.  Just other ways to experience the sonic games. Can't complain.  Nice addition. I do like the extra cutscenes in the beginning of the games. It would have been nice to include more throughout the game.  But I'm not complaining with what we got. 

- Mission Mode.  I was expecting it to be a redundant last minute thought. Something similar to what the NES remix thing did. ""Here is first stage. Kill X amount of things / get amount of rings and reach the goal"" Instead it's either a specific section / modified level having me do specific things. Which I quite enjoyed. I am enjoying it WAY more than I was expecting it to.  Like, my only gripe is I wish there were MORE included. Mind you i've only done about 20% of it. BUT damn. They are fun.  I was expecting to do a few and get bored. But I'm actually enjoying Mission mode. Way more thought out than what I was expecting.  Way more fun as well.  I spent the first hour or so on mission mode alone.  I'm just surprised how much I'm enjoying them.

Sonic Origins is an overall fun experience.  Adds a bit extra for the fans, adds a lot to new comers.  My downsides? I mean give us 3D blast / spinball / chaotix / game gear games. Just more classic sonic content.  Been playing these games for ages now and I'm still enjoying them today.

823,117457968,english,"It's nowhere near as bad as some people make it out to be in their reviews but there are still some glaring issues.

The biggest one for me is the image quality, for some reason the games don't look very sharp. It almost looks like like they scaled the game up to 720p internally, then used interpolation for the rest. I'm not sure if this is what they did but it still doesn't look very great.

There's also a disgusting lack of customizability. When you play the game in anniversary/story mode you're forced to play with spin dash, drop dash, and infinite lives. Why can't we toggle these off? Why are all these settings are bundled together?

Drop dash is also another issue because it just feels... wrong. The way they implemented it feels rather inaccurate to Mania. This wouldn't be a huge issue to me normally because I don't even want to play these games with drop dash, but as I said we cannot really turn it off so... yeah...

And of course there's also the issue with the replaced music in Sonic 3. I love the original protoype tracks but these replacement tracks somehow manage to be much worse than those leaked proto tracks which is baffling.

Outside these issues this is a fantastic collection. Finally being be able to play these games in widescreen in an official fashion is a blessing, the option to retry special stages is awesome, the entire recreation of Sonic 3&K here is super well done, and the menus are rather pretty. I'm really enjoying the mission mode as well, though it isn't exactly mindblowing stuff. Same with the gallery I guess, there are some songs and concept art to unlock but it isn't going to hold your attention for too long.

And I mean, in the end, this is a collection if 3 fantastic games (and Sonic 1), it would be hard to completely hate it unless they messed up the games real bad.

I guess in the end I think the collection is good, just not $40 good. It's not as big of a disaster as Sonic Colors Ultimate that's for sure, I cannot believe they actually had the balls to release that mess.

- The game uses poor sprite scaling (likely linear/bilinear rather than integer) that makes the in-game graphics look blurrier than Mania or any of the mobile remasters. This does not appear to be a problem with any other platforms.

- The UI looks astonishingly blurry on high-resolution displays, as if it was created for a 720p  display and then stretched with, again, poor filtering.

- The sharp/smooth/CRT filtering options from previous releases have been completely removed.

- There is no way to play the games in the widescreen ""remastered"" mode with the original lives system. You're required to either use the new coins system that removes lives as a mechanic or play in a letterboxed square.

- The game does not obey Windows display scaling. Running in a borderless window will cause the game to take up a small chunk of the display.

- The game has vsync issues. I get screen tearing issues owing to the game locking to 59fps instead of 60fps.

- The music used for Sonic 3's Carnival Night, Ice Cap, and Launch Base zones are sharp downgrades from the prototype versions people thought we were getting. Sega directly stated these would use the original genesis soundchip, but they instead appear to be based on MIDI versions from the mid-90s PC collection. It's rough - Carnival Night in particular sounds like it's from a completely different system, terribly muffled/muddy and with a melody that's almost entirely absent due to poor mixing.

- Bugs that were present in the original release of Mania have found their way back in, including bad Tails pathfinding. There are lots of scenarios where Tails will end up stuck on springs off-screen, producing terrible noises.

- There are new and exciting physics bugs in Sonic 3 surrounding changing water levels and almost every stage gimmick.

- Drop Dash locks your direction in Sonic 1 and Sonic 2, and the way it interacts with slopes in those games makes it basically unusable.

- The DLC is a blatant cash grab, and would've just been cute add-ins for any other collection.

- The game's encrypted with Denuvo, so while some of this can be fixed by mods (like sound files), expecting anything deeper is a tall order. For the price, the community shouldn't be expected to fix the game's shortcomings.

I have a lot of other nitpicks (why are the options are tucked away in the Museum, why can you not change keyboard key binds, and why can you not move with the arrow keys?), but almost every one of these is a dealbreaker. This release is astonishingly buggy and rushed, and until/unless Sega addresses some of the many issues, this is just a worse way to play games you can already play just about anywhere else.

I feel like a lot of the additional features make up for it, 60 FPS, widescreen, Special Stage Restart, Autosave checkpoints, the mission modes are actually a ton of fun and remind me of those NES Remix packs for the Wii U.  If I was a kid playing this for the first time and coming off the Sonic 1 or 2 movie hype I'd be losing my mind!

Older fans like myself who are expecting this to be a 1:1 faithful recreation of everything they remember from their childhood to stay the same are going to be disappointed.  This does a great job at repackaging these older games for modern audiences, and for everything else there's Day 1 Mods.

847,117468543,english,"Hoo boy, where do I start. First, a bit of background info; like many people looking at this game, I have copies of all these games accross multiple platforms. So for me, if you're going to charge £37 I'm going to want something extra. For me, the mirror mode and missions were that, as well as a good, high quality definitive version of the game. £37 is steep, but justifiable, I guess.

Firstly, uh, I guess I have to talk about the DRM. For me it worked fine with no noticible lag, but I can't say that that it'll work for everyone. Or work forever. Or work when the servers get shut down. Why does this game need DRM, Sega? Almost everyone wanting to buy this game has a version of it on some other platform. Or a way to access the original if they wanted to pirate it. I'd forgive almost everything else if it wasn't for this dumb descision.

For the graphics, I'll reiterate what other people have mentioned about the ""fuzziness"". These games are low resolution, and so are displayed ""pixelated"". However, the way they've implemented the scaling of graphics means there's a blurry line that ""blends"" between the edges between two pixels, making them feel less crisp. If you have the game, you can notice it really easily by pausing the game; the pause menu looks much crisper than the game itself. This is a mistake that people working with pixel art should be aware of, and it's not a mistake that should be made here (""Integer Scaling"" is what you want here).

And yes, there is an option for anti-aliasing; that is turned off for me. Turning it on makes things much more blurry (which is what you want if you're looking for an authetic CRT look). Wait, why is there no option for fake scanlines like Mania had?

Anyway, the new content, which I justified the steeper price to myself for.

The mirror mode... I think that's on me, I was expecting something better. I was hoping it started the level at the ending signpost, and you ran through the level backwards. Instead, it's just mirroring the screen so everything goes right to left. It's still cool and interesting, but not worth £37. Shouldn't be that hard to implement in an emulator either; just flip the display before rendering it.

The mission mode is lackluster. I was expecting more for £37. For each game in the collection, you get 15 missions (18 if you spend more money! Or preorder? I forget which). Each mission is less than a minute long and is some arbitary challange that you do, and its super easy to get an S. I would have like to have seen maybe 5 challanges per zone? I was hoping for some custom level edits (beyond what they've done by adding cubes and badniks to the existing levels). Or even something as simple as ""beat the entire level in 1:30"", or without getting hurt.

Spending money on a remake in the new engine of the old Sonic games is something I'm perfectly willing to do... Just not £37 on a subpar, DRM ridden cash grab. My condolonces to the people working on the game who genuinely wanted it to be a good, authentic remake.

One last thing... When playing the game, the mouse is not hidden and always visible. Come on Sega, why would you think that that's okay?

the title screen looks nice, and gives you a good first impression
But the games. Ohhh the games.
first of all, in anniversary mode you're FORCED to get coins instead of lives. why is lives tied to classic mode? that's stupid. what if you wanna play with lives but with the 16:9 aspect ratio? i guess you're just screwed then!
not to mention you only have to pay one coin to retry a special stage. you can just stock up on coins super easily and get infinite retries?? 100 rings gives you 1 single coin, similar to lives. why? i dont know! it's stupid
second of all, the bugs. ohhh my lord the bugs.
it just never ends. collision errors, softlocks, you name it. if you can give it a name, this game probably has it. did anybody even playtest this?
sometimes a basic function like THE DROP DASH doesn't work. i've seen clips of people dropdashing, getting hit, and still getting the boost when they hit the ground.
i saw someone beat ice cap act 2's boss without even starting it.
i saw someone wrong warp from mushroom hill all the way to hidden palace in sonic 3.
the audio is super muffled in the games for whatever reason, not to mention sonic 3's new tracks.
the new tracks are incredibly scuffed versions of the prototype tracks. the proto versions sounded fine. why not just use those?
super sonic's theme in sonic 3 sounds like it was taken straight from sonic 4. how do you screw this up so bad?
theres also no knuckles in sonic cd. he's in every other game! why not sonic cd? i don't know. i can't even think of a valid reason.
overall, i believe the game is a buggy piece of shitassery that shouldn't be purchased in it's current state.

851,117457559,english,"Yep. It's Classic Sonic. for the uhh... 150th time. This is definitely the definitive way to play these games. Wide Screen, consistent 60fps, all of it. Except for the Music in 3&k had to be replaced *for obvious reasons*. It is disappointing to see they took just about all the other versions of these games down to release this. I don't know for sure why. 

The DLC/Deluxe edition don't really add much. It's basically just new unlockables. The music DLC literally just lets you unlock the Remixes from other games to play them through the In-game music player. The Fun Pack just adds unlockable behind the scenes stuff. Animatics and stuff. Hard Missions are also apart of the DLC but I have yet to get to playing them. 

The content that is added to the collection are super nice and all, but like... theres really only like 3 or 4 notable things. 

Each game now has a new Into and Outro animation. I absolutely adore all of them! they also kept in the CD into and outro and even went out of their way to make them as HD as possible! 

Coins replace Lives in Anniversary mode. So now Death just kinda means you have to start the level over. Coins are used to unlock things in the museum and retry Special Stages. Super welcome addition! Classic mode is still here...-ish? It basically just reduces the screen to it's original format and brings back lives. But it doesn't seem to remove parts of Sonic's Moveset that might've been in the original games. There's really not much reason to play these. 

Drop Dash is now apart of Classic Sonic's moveset! All I can say is these levels were absolutely not designed around it. Metal Sonic is too easy to beat with it. Spindash is available in Sonic 1, which is absolutely busted. and you have the option to use either the CD or Sonic 2 spindash in CD. You can also still chose what soundtrack you want to use in CD. 


Right now, this *is* the definitive way to play these games, and I would recommend it. But Jesus the 3D island really reduces who can play this game on PC... 
there should've at least been an option to toggle the 3D stuff. 
$40USD is very debatable. I'm very mixed on recommending this just on Price alone. 

If you just want to play these games in HD and 60fps, and Not on your phone, than here you are. But the $40 pricetag really is too high for this imo. maybe $30 or $25 would've been a lot more reasonable. I wonder if we'll even be able to mod this game...

Idk, I enjoy these games, and I already have beaten both 1 and CD, so I can't really refund at this point. I'll try to find more to do in this game.

Also, minor nitpicking here but Sonic CD's default soundtrack is the US one, which is objectively worse than the JP one. So that's cool.

CONS that probably won't be fixed:
[list]
    [*]No options on what abilities you want for each game. You get the spin dash and drop dash + whatever abilities are native to the game. While modders will probably make it possible, the fact that you can't simply toggle which one you want is silly.
 [*] Specifically made cutscenes aside, this collection doesn't offer any new or behind the scenes stuff that wasn't already made available before.
[*] While new features like playable knuckles in S1 or spin dash in S1 are nice, it's all stuff that was already seen in rom hacks years ago. Missed opportunity to really show something new and unique.

875,117496807,english,"This is simultaneously the best and most disappointing collection for the classic era of Sonic games.
While the games are built from the ground up using the Retro Engine, the lack of content is really disheartening. Sonic Mega Collection Plus has twenty games and a treasure trove of gallery content, while also coming out nearly 20 years ago. I'll admit the galley content in Origins IS really cool for long-time fans, but there could be so much more.

As for the games themselves...
Sonic 1 was perfect, all things considered. After a few dozen re-releases, I think this is the definitive way to play the original game. The ability to retry Special Stages (which is included in every game) is especially helpful for Sonic 1. Overall: a perfect port for a perfect game.
Sonic 2, as well, had almost no faults. The biggest issue is Tails's AI, which seems to stay stuck for well over half the stage before realizing he's making your ears bleed and warping back to you (I've learned forcing him to fly helps when this happens). Everything from the iOS/Android remaster is here and accounted for, and I'm glad to see this finally officially available on PC and Consoles. Another (near) perfect way to play this masterpiece.
Sonic CD is virtually just the 2011 remaster, with the inclusion of the lyrics in the opening and ending for the JP/EU Soundtrack (Toot-Toot, Sonic Warrior!) While my opinions on this game go back and forth as much as this game's level design, I can't deny that this is a solid entry in the series and deserves to be checked out by any Sonic fan. Another flawless port.

And then we get to Sonic 3 & Knuckles... Where do I begin?
This is like the ""George Lucas Special Editions"" of the Sonic series. There's a lot of small additions to this game that range from quality of life (Super Sonic sprites touched up, better rotation effects) to downright baffling (random sound effect additions or changes that don't alter the experience, but felt unnecessary). Then there's the whole music fiasco. Blah-Blah-Blah, Carnival Night, Ice Cap and Launch Base all have different tunes. But nobody decided to tell me that they made a new song for Super Sonic's Transformation? It's not amazing, but it's better than the Invincibility Theme. Then during the final cutscene there's yet another random new song? Not terrible, in fact I'd say it's an improvement, but why? Just so many weird things about this remaster that makes no sense after playing the original (and AIR) for years. Another point on the audio: some SFX and BGM sound muffled / compressed, like Knuckles' Theme. It comes off very rushed and that they didn't put that much time to have the same level of quality the other 3 games have in their ports.

Mission Mode is fun, for the most part. Some of the later difficulty Missions get downright frustrating (looking at you Sky Chase Zone levels) and the Extreme Difficulty ones aren't much to write home about.

OH YEAH, there's the whole DLC debacle. There is literally no reason any of the DLC should have been DLC. This should've either been included in the base game or been in a free update in the future. Making it an extra $5 is such a pointless cash-grab that I, admittedly, fell for and I'm here to warn others to not be as stupid as me who fell for it because I'm such a fan of this franchise.

TLDR
Sonic Origins is an all-around competent collection of the Blue Blur's first four platforming adventures on the Genesis. While the changes to Sonic 3 will make old fans VERY disappointed, let's all be happy we're on PC, right? ;-)
While PC players have many other options to play these games, I'd say the bonus content (especially the cutscenes) make this experience worth it for long-time fans and newcomers that've viewed this series from a distance for some time and want a good point to jump in with the Classic Era.",1656049602,1656049602,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198100519288,400,13,637,637,637,1656046775,1794960.0
876,117492856,english,"I'm going to write this review primarily about the Sonic 3 & Knuckles component of Origins, since that's where all my time went.

I'm not sure what to say for this one. I've been pretty hyped for Origins, since S3&K is genuinely one of my favorite retro titles and we haven't seen any kind of re-release for it in some time. Unfortunately it seems like we didn't actually get that, and instead we ended up getting something dancing around trying to pretend it's S3&K. As someone who plays through the original on a very regular basis, this port just feels *off*. 

Sonic does NOT handle smoothly. You seem to stick to some surfaces, mid-air control is nonexistent, some surfaces will send you flying at weird angles, and some gaps will be ""fine"" one second and then randomly crush you the next. The original genesis Sonic titles were always about fast paced gameplay with extremely tight controls and it feels like NONE of that transitioned over. There seems to be an inconsistent input latency layered on top of everything, as some times Sonic would wait before responding to my jump, while other times I had to purposefully slow down my input of spin dashing because the game would arbitrarily decide to respond to the jump button BEFORE the fact that i was holding down.

Maybe the included versions of Sonic 1 / 2 / CD are great (since they use the pre-existing mobile ports), but the attempt at S3&K most certainly is not. I could forgive the $40 pricetag for yet another re-release, the lack of original licensed music, the use of Denuvo, or even the blatant cash grab DLC; But somehow Sega took a nigh perfect game, and found a way to drain the fun out of it.

The two biggest points of contention here (three if you count Denuvo, ugh) are the replaced music tracks in Sonic 3 and the $40 price tag. The new music is... complete garbage, to put it gently. Both the final and prototype versions of the music are way better than this, and thankfully it's easy to mod either of them back into this game! It feels like a bad stain on an otherwise perfect remaster of one of the best games of all time, so I'd definitely recommend modding it before you play.

Sonic Origins is a good collection of 4 classic Sonic titles - Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 and Sonic CD. There is story mode allowing to play through all those games as if one single coherent experience, then there is boss rush mode and anniversary mode for all the games. There are online rankings which nobody really cares about and an in-built music player. Many bonuses are locked behind a ""paywall"" in the form of special coins you have to earn via playing in order to unlock many bonuses. There is a lot of nice animated cutscenes as if it´s an old animation movie.

If you are a fan of Sonic then ...what?!! 40 EUR?!! No way... No, it is too much even if it means 1 game for 10 EUR. It´s just these game are so old that I cannot recommend it for thise price. For, let´s say [strike]20 bucks[/strike]... no, for 15 bucks it will be an awesome buying.

Since my personal review policies never took prices into account (because nevertheless a game costs 50 bucks or 5 bucks, it is still just the same game with the same gameplay), I recommend this collection because the games are just good. The price is not that good tho...

Yeah, Capcom. A full mouse support for browsing the menus would be welcomed. The game has just a lazy mouse support, not ideal at all.

Also bear in mind that I am not a Sonic fanboy so I may never tell differencies (if there are some) in sounds or music or even graphics between this version and the original versions. I am not any competent player for such a detailed info.

Some initial thoughts on the game on launch day (6/23) with a couple hours played.

- New cutscenes are BEAUTIFUL. Powerhouse Team did an incredible job with these cutscenes, and they put a lot of love into them.

- Sonic 1 and 2 are ports of the mobile version, with drop dash lazily added into it. Drop dash causes some issues in both games (controls are locked in a rolling jump). Gameplay is essentially the same as it was in the mobile ports otherwise, which was pretty good. 

- Sonic CD is the same as the 2011 release, reusing most of the same menus from it. The soundtrack options are in the actual Sonic CD game so in order to change the soundtrack you have to actually go into the game from Anniversary or Classic mode to do so (there's no option to change it from the Story mode). Being that it is a re-release of the 2011 version this also means that Knuckles isn't playable in it, which is rather disappointing. 

- S3K is probably where the most issues are. Music quality sounds really bad and graphically it doesn't look anywhere near as good as the other three games. Some of the physics seem a bit.. off, more than in 1, 2 or CD. AIR probably spoiled a lot of us with how many features and all of the customization it has, but this ""remaster"" is just nowhere near the same quality. Pretty disappointed here.

- The museum mode is neat but there are a lot of incorrectly labeled songs in it (this is mostly part of the deluxe version but it's worth noting in here). Door Into Summer is the wrong song completely (and RIP because it's a banger) and some songs within Sonic Spinball are incorrect. Song quality is also really inconsistent. If you're going to make people pay more for the deluxe version of the game, at least give people the highest quality (and actually get the stuff right lmao).

- Additional modes are cool. Mission mode has a lot of neat challenges, mirror mode is a fun twist to play all the stages backwards, and boss rush is.. well, boss rush. Not worth the price, but they're a fun addition.

- No online multiplayer for S2 or S3. Seriously?

I am really excited to see what the community does with this game via modding but [b] for right now I can't really recommend the game at its current price [/b]. The additional mission mode and the museum are not enough content to justify the price of the game, especially with as many issues as there are with it. Otherwise, I hope we get a patch to fix some of these issues soon (but SEGA track record on these fixes is pretty bad, just thinking back to Colors Ultimate).

This is the definitive way to experience the classic Sonic games, aside from a few minor nitpicks, and the drop-dash definitely makes the games so much easier and fun to play! I'm also really glad they removed lives and added coins instead since I'm pretty bad at the classic games lmao. Outside of the issues I mentioned before, the game runs flawlessly with no frame drops or lag. My biggest issue is with the key-bindings which are absolutely terrible and for some reason, it wouldn't let me change them to how I wanted them. Fortunately, the game is much better controlled with an Xbox controller so I won't be using the keyboard much. Some of the Sonic 3&K music is also vastly inferior due to it being a recreation of the prototype tracks, but the prototype tracks somehow sound so much more finished than the versions used in Origins.

895,117458589,english,"TLDR: forced filtering and jacked-up performance, seemingly an fps/refresh mismatch that causes severe game-ruining stutter if you don't have a VRR display

All I really wanted from this collection was to finally be able to play Sonic 3 & Knuckles in 16:9... when I woke up this morning and gamers weren't rejoicing in the streets I had my suspicions, and reading the reviews on Steam gave me more cause for concern, but I smuggly assumed that those losers had failed to turn off a filter or put the resolution wrong or something; they aren't smart & cool like me so they don't get to hang out with Sonic the Hedgehog(TM) and his furry (non-sexual) friends.

So imagine my shock when it turned out that the mad lads at Sega managed to fuck up! Haha, whoa, that doesn't usually happen! What did they do? Forced filtering.

https://u.cubeupload.com/arekkusu/202206231346361.jpg - Sonic Origins S3&K
https://u.cubeupload.com/arekkusu/202206231345061.jpg - emulated S3&K no filter
https://u.cubeupload.com/arekkusu/202206231418211.jpg - emulated S3&K w/ bilinear filtering

(The only option for a filter is this ""anti-aliasing"" filter, which was disabled in previous screenshots: 
https://u.cubeupload.com/arekkusu/202206231404291.jpg Obviously, this filter is dog shit and should be avoided.)

The way that pixels are blurred together and the general unfocussed look of the image seem similar to the emulated game with bilinear enabled, but not quite as bad. The pixels themselves look fine, I don't think the sprite is badly scaled and I can't see any long pixels or anything weird, it's just filtered in this undesirable way. I do think that if this fix this, it'll look quite good.

Other than the widescreen and the forced filter, nothing has really been done to S3&K. The game has what could be perceived as stutter due to the way that Sonic stops for a frame when you (for one example) jump and that's something I would probably have changed if I was charging £36 for this. I feel like perhaps there are other stutters here too. For some reason, the VRR readout on my TV fluctuates between ~57–59 while playing— wait hold on I should test this...

HAHAHAHAHAHAH it's completely fucked with VRR turned off! I tested Sonic 1 like this, and experienced constant stuttering that made the game unplayable. Sonic CD was better, settling instead for one biiiiig stutter every few seconds instead. Fantastic work, guys. 

Don't buy this. They need to fix the performance and they need to give us the option for nice clean pixels.

A couple of smaller complaints:

- the animations are cool but how tf do you make a cool OP and then not slap some cheesy vocals on there? With Sonic CD in here it feels incongruous.

- new UI elements that appear in the game are much higher-res than the game and look bad as a result.

edit: I didn't realise before, but the anti-aliasing filter in the game is almost a 1:1 match with how the emulated game looks with bilinear filtering.

I am a huge Sonic fan. Sonic 3 & Knuckles is still to this day my favourite game of all time. It is hard to give any new comer a proper description of how good atleast this one title in the collection of four really is. We have made almost 30 years of progress in game design but the game still holds up well. I would probably not recommend it to anyone who is not a sonic fan and as such there probably is also no need to even recommend it as sonic fans will or will eventually buy the game. 

Currently many might feel it is over priced, nothing a special wouldnt fix. What is the fair value? That is up to the buyer.

There are a few improvements for S3&K. Sonic now has more subtle animations when it comes to his rotation on the barrels in carnival night zone, probably added due to more storage. Super Sonic also benefits from this as his animations has also been fleshed out such as the rotation on the hydrocity lifts. Flashing sprites are replaced with transparent ones and special stages feels extra smooth.

There are noticable flaws in the game. Physics are largely the same but swings in angle island swings you through spikes, the hydrocity air jets pushes you up making it impossible to get a specific 1-up. The special stage at the end of act 2 is unreachable because of the increased frame rate not allowing you to properly clip up the ledge. The large offence is the one everyone has heard about. The Jackson music is missing from Carnival Night, Ice Cap and Launchbase instead replaced by the pc midi and original proto type music. 

Not speaking of the package as a whole but with a few patches the bugs can be fixed. Sadly the music can't. Other than that I welcome the changes.",1656009845,1656009845,True,2,0,0.518248140811920166,0,True,False,False,76561197970773758,558,47,245,245,140,1656019674,1794960.0

If you Like this game, Good on ya, Its still a good idea to try out the others tho, Im sure most of the problems with the stuttering and optimisation Is because of Denuvo, SEGA has it on around launch in their games because they are scared people would Pirate it around the launch window and that is where they get the most sales. You know, Sales they could use to buy the soundtrack of Sonic 3 With but they wont :).

I would say that other than that, the games themselves are great. Since these are the 4 classic titles, these would be pretty fun experience and would be the definitive way to play them if SEGA will fix these issues

It's not anything mind-blowing, but fans will appreciate the new cutscenes and extra presentation and gameplay gubbins. Finally having some way to play Sonic 1 and 2 on something besides mobile (officially anyway) is very good, not to mention having Sonic 3&K playable in widescreen at all. Mission mode is a neat little diversion, story mode seems like a good way to just blitz through all the games in one string, the new Blue Spheres levels are fun if you're into that, and the museum is a nice bonus. 

I also appreciate the new coins system, as it makes playing special stages less of a headache. For purists, they will like that the original versions are included for preservation's sake (though no way to play Sonic 3 and S&K separately? Bit of a nitpick, but if you're going to include the original roms, might as well add that extra bit, yes?). A lot of people may balk at the ""new"" music in S3&K, but I enjoy these beta tracks and I'm glad that their existence allows Sega to re-release the game finally. Music is subjective, yadda-yadda

Denuvo sucks but doesn't impact gameplay, and the DLC and pre-order nickle-and-diming sucks but ultimately doesn't take that much away from the core experience. Depending on your priorities, one might also find these games to be too old for the price tag, though I personally think the price was just fine for what I got (four not-unsizeable games with updated presentation and gameplay and a variety of side challenges).

The only thing I enjoyed from these ports is the animated cutscenes, being able to replay the special stages if you fail them and the addition of the drop dash from Mania. Everything else is just the original classics, even in the anniversary mode. Which has these coins instead of lives.

I know I will anger some people but I literally grew up in the modern era of Sonic. Here's my refund message for context:
""If Christian Whitehead helped with this game, I could give it a pass but honestly, even then, playing the original sonic games is a task for me.

961,117494099,english,"Oh god what a let down this was.

So first off, the game ran HORRIBLY, mainly suffering ALOT of slowdown whenever the game saved, started a level, came off from the main menu or entering a Special Stage; majority of the time pausing and unpausing would fix the slowdown but around Lava Reef in S3&K the slowdown would happen way more often, maybe it was because of Hyper Sonic? Honestly majority of these issues seem more than likely caused by Denuvo DRM, which from last time it was used in a Classic Sonic title (Sonic Mania) it ran horribly. So I was wishing they'd had some hindsight.

The controls in Sonic 1, CD and 2 are all messed up. Main example being that the drop dash is implemented in a way where when you land you don't do the dash immediately and instead it keeps you vulnerable for a frame before doing a SHORT spindash. Alongside this when rolling your controls are locked to just jumping, you are incapable of doing ANY course correction or even changing the direction you're dashing with the Drop Dash.

During Sonic CD specifically the sound effects are all sorts of messed up, what comes to mind first for it being the air timer and drowning being pitched up and out of sync. The goal post spinning and other sound effects also end up sounding like they're played through a botched emulator, maybe even an AtGames Mega Drive.

In Sonic 3 & Knuckles, the most promising of the games in this batch, the music and sound effects sound really muffled or compressed at times, and the new remixes of the Prototype tracks are flat and out of key at points. And don't get me started on the special stages, I had gotten all 7 Chaos Emeralds by Marble Garden ACT 1, during which I was able to transform into Super Sonic fine. By ACT 2 my Chaos Emeralds had reset to 1 for some reason, in which I had to get all of them AGAIN. And even after that touching a Giant Ring would make me repeat the seventh Blue Spheres stage instead of giving me 50 rings, despite me already having the emeralds. This problem was fixed by Mushroom Hill ACT 1 though due to how the Super Emeralds work. Speaking of the Super Emeralds, using Hyper Sonic is a nightmare. So they never removed his rapidly flashing colour palette or screen clearing flash of white, infact they only made the screen flash worse by adding a hyper quick fade in/out.

These experiences were all from one marathon of the Story Mode, and while the new cutscenes and visual additions to S3&K were great and fun, the problems listed above were enough to make my favourite games a miserable experience.

Overall this is a pretty bad collection and remaster, bringing bugs and issues to already perfected versions of Sonic 1, CD and 2 (Mobile, IOS/Android) and a decent but buggy remaster of Sonic 3 & Knuckles, which supposedly according to Stealth from Headcannon on Twitter, is not what they handed SEGA fully.

If I was to recommend this it'd be hopefully after the game gets patched, as I can see this becoming my main way to play these games if the launch wasn't botched.
Instead I'd recommend the Mobile ports of these games and maybe emulating Sonic 3, I would recommend them all from steam but SEGA removed being able to buy the Mega Drive versions of these games a month or two ago to make way for this.

Play Sonic 1 Forever, Sonic 2 Absolute, Sonic CD decompilled and Sonic 3 Angel Island Revisited if you want a PC widescreen Sonic experience, all of these require dumps of the payed versions of the games from mobile and a rom back up of Sonic 3, methods for obtaining a rom I cannot give as SEGA's official version of Sonic 3 & Knuckles no longer exists here, which S3AIR used.",1656044814,1656044814,False,2,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False,76561198137949242,71,4,757,757,757,1656043590,1794960.0

all mainline 2D sonic games in one package(excluding mania)

cool new animations tying all the games together perfectly

new challenge mode/ unlock-able things(pictures,music ect)

lyrical versions of ""you can do anything"" and ""cosmic eternity"" are now back in sonic CD

Mirror Mode

its 2D sonic so if you like that then this is beautiful

Cons
Price tag may be to high for some

Horrible DLC(can you even call that dlc why wasn't it just in the game already?)

because of the whole MJ copyright stuff wirh sonic 3 some songs had to be taken out and were replaced with horrible midi tracks instead of the beta genesis tracks(dunno why)

the audio is a bit off(not sure where they got the audio from but from time to time it can sound glitchy and very low quality)

considering that these are the whitehead ports the games look somewhat blury and not pixel perfect

very little customization with each game (think of something like sonic 3 air, sonic 1 forever, or sonic 2 complete. those were all fan remakes for pc that had a whole slew of things you can change about each games so they'd be just right for you.....now think of this where there are barely any changes you can make to the games which is kinda a letdown)

thats all the cons I could find now since I'm only 4 hours in

So uh yea I think this is a pretty good package. the price may be high for some so if that's true for you then wait until it goes on sale in like....what a couple of months?

I don't know why Sega team or Sonic Team or Christian Whitehead do, but it seems like this game was like need 4 times specs requirement than ""Sonic Mania"" itself.

Heck even Sonic Mania could run on my Core 2 Duo PC.

The next problem is the music (but not with replacement music S3&K because Michael Jackson lawsuit)

- The Music and SFX was not balance, even the something was missing SFX from previous Mobile version

- The music was really low quality, even hard to hear the BGM because not balance with the SFX

The Control

OMG this is F*cked and clunky delay as hell, I thought my PS4 Controller was got an issue. But while I'm using the keyboard, the delay still there.

And I check my PS4 Controller again and play it on my Mobile version Sonic 1, it's great as it is. 
Like WTF just happened with this game???

DeNuvo issue

GOD, DID EVEN SEGA STILL HEARING US?!!!!

Look, this DRM made some problem with my PC, here's the list problem Sonic Games with DeNuvo

- Sonic Mania, need always ONLINE mode. (Fortunatelly this was removed and reduce the file size)
- Sonic Forces (stuttering issue because this DRM, even with high specs)
- Sonic Colors Ultimate on Epic Games (Same with Forces, but worse because broken f*cking game, hopefully if Sega see this, they consider it to removed this on Steam version later)

To be honest, I don't recommended buy this game for now, except they fixed some issue inside the game

580.000 IDR a.k.a 45 USD for broken deluxe game, I don't know man.....

Even for that Price, I still consider to buy Sonic Colors Ultimate on Steam later because Epic Games login issue problem and bad server for downloading the games.

Or maybe waiting for Sonic Frontiers which I don't know anything about the story

1) The review isn't yet fully finished, with both cons and pros not entirely done, as (my lazy self) will come back to add more in an edit later when i feel like it.

2) Parts of this review are satirical in nature, while some are just simply either my take or opinion.

3) For simplicity's sake, I will refer to Michael Jackson as ""MJ"" for easier reference and less lengthy text.
----

CONS:

Denuvo (Let's punish people who actually want to play the game and at the same time make it easier instead of more difficult for people to pirate!) I'm going to say it now as is for some other people, it runs on extremely low frames. (Personally on my end, it ran a solid 1-12 frames per second, Thanks Denuvo, for the stuttering!)

Music. (For once, a sonic game that doesn't have at least decent music!?)
Maybe it's just me and I'm crazy for thinking so, but I honestly do not find interest in some of the music. I understand the removal of some tracks considering the whole MJ situation, and that's completely fine. What isn't fine in my eyes is removing music that wasn't even connected to MJ himself. (I'm of course talking about ever so infamous Ice Cap Zone, which more closely resembles the song ""Hard Times"" by The Jetzons.)

No custom keybindings (You want to use A to jump? Sorry, none of that here.)

1024,116009803,english,"Vampire Survivor is one of those strange games that, looked from the outside, might seem like a low effort project because of the cheap-looking sprites and unpolished graphics in general.
But once you start playing it, you realize: ""Woah, this is the real deal! How can something so cheap (it costs 2,39€), something still in early access, something not yet fully content complete be this fun and addicting?!"".

At least that's what I kept telling myself as I kept playing. 46 hours later I am still having a blast with it. The developer keeps adding a ton of things with every new update, obviously as the game is still in early access, and even when they say ""oh, sorry but this is a light update"" you end up with new areas, new secret bosses, new evolutions, new characters and you feel like the dev is punking you.

I am truly amazed by this game, as it is a simple yet well thought out experience at its core that doesn't get bogged down by grinding (you can grind tho if you like).
I also appreciate the humor and references in it, which cover a lot of areas, not just other games, but also things like old anime shows or some real people (really easy to get if you're Italian).

So yeah, I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to have some fun leveling up while dodging enemies on the road to become a death machine vomiting projectiles and lasers and axes and crosses and daggers and whatever else to survive the onslaught coming your way.",1653515195,1653515195,True,2,0,0.556038498878479004,0,True,False,True,76561198055770803,7444,41,3359,88,2773,1655686654,1794680.0

This game is influenced by Castlevania in much the same way as a fur cap is influenced by a Raccoon, but considering what Konami is doing with the IP right now, it doesn't bother me. The basic ghosts-and-goblins vibe of oldschool Castlevania is combined with the horde-and-item gameplay of Risk Of Rain, and the result is something that has absolutely no business being even half as fun as it is. 

Despite the simplistic premise, the game has a surprising amount of depth and thought put into it - almost every weapon has a pairing with an item that evolves it into a much stronger version, usually with additional properties to match. 

There are numerous alternative characters to play as, but none of them lock you into a preset playstyle, and figuring out how to assemble a build so staggeringly broken you can just stand in place and watch the carnage never gets old. These factors together give the game a lot of replay value, and that's without getting into the secret characters, items, and levels that can be uncovered.

1121,117434671,english,"As a fan of the God of War franchise, this game was truly an amazing experience and is definitely one of the best games I've played.

The story: The story is a beautiful one. Kratos and his BOY Atreus set out on a journey to scatter the ashes of Atreus' mother Faye, at her dying request. This journey isn't as straightforward, as they are hunted by the Nordic gods, for reasons that become clear in the game. The story sees the growth of the father-son relationship, Kratos as an outsider who wants to put his past life behind, the growth of Atreus as a Warrior God and also the development towards a certain famed Nordic event, that will be revealed in the game.

The characters: The lead characters Kratos and Atreus have been depicted quite well, with their words and action always in line with their developing personalities. The side characters are a delight especially Mimir and the dwarves.

The combat: This is possibly my favorite part of the game. Due to the new camera which is just behind the shoulder of Kratos, each fight feels much more visceral. Unlike the previous installments in the franchise, combat here is strategic and requires planning. The weapon, skill and gear upgrades are all different and hence can be tailored according to the fighting style of the player, which I found particularly useful.

The visuals: Graphics in this game are an experience. The detail in the world and characters is breathtaking and really adds to the overall gaming experience.

1182,116868073,english,"One of the best games I have played in the last few years if not ever. I have almost no critiques and maybe it's because I have literally just finished the game as I'm writing this but this game is almost flawless.

I'll get the negatives out of the way and trust me they are very nit picky. Firstly, when interacting with things the game sometimes wants you stood a certain distance and a certain angle from something before you are given the prompt to interact but this is fairly few and far between moments just slightly frustrating when they do happen. By the time you begin to near the end of the game the map becomes far too clustered to understand what is going on with so many icons and its already poor design from an efficiency stand point, putting visuals ahead of practicality, it is impossible to read. This isn't a huge issue though as you barely use the map with your compass being your main source of direction it's just the cluttered icons can look quite ugly. There are quite a few QTEs that some people may find annoying, personally I am not bothered but I know some people really dislike them but I'm sure there is an option to turn them off. My final small issue is I think the game has a small case of Rockstar syndrome, feeling that almost every mission has to be a brawl, now it really isn't that big of a deal here like it is in Red Dead Redemption 2 but there were a few points during the game where I juts felt like I had been running through hoards of enemies for no real reason. 

Now that I've allowed myself to complain let's get get to the good stuff. The story is an absolute masterpiece, I will do my best to stay spoiler free. The main focus and objective throughout stays exactly the same and the game will tease you with it letting you get very close then ripping it away again and again. This is what makes the story interesting, these set backs, and the people you meet that may aid you or set you back some doing both even those the very closest to you. Kratos' backstory is very important to many of the driving points of this plot. I do not think it necessary to have had played the previous trilogy but at least update yourself by watching a youtube video as I think many moments would lose their impact if you don't entirely understand what they are referencing. As I'm on the topic of the last games, if you have played them and are worried this game just won't be the same don't worry there are still many crazy outlandish fights to be had. The new camera angle is an improvement for the type of game this is being a bit more slower paced I think it is important you feel more connected with Kratos. They also have a thing where the whole game is done in one shot which is true but it doesn't make a huge difference and is more of a marketing gimmick than anything. The best relationship throughout the game is the one you play. The one between Kratos and Atreus develops and changes so much as both characters grow closer. Certain aspects of the plot do feel a bit weird as the pacing can rapidly speed up but that may have been me not doing as many side quests towards the end of the game.

Speaking of side quests they are really impressive. Many of them do repeat a similar structure such as: go to cave, kill big thing, get reward or get thing for spirit, get betrayed or rewarded but there are some real gems in here and some storylines that carry over more than just one side quest and integrate with others. Sometimes they can really slow down the pacing of the game and that's why I stood back from them towards the end just so I could keep that endgame tension without interruptions but obviously you play how you want and I don't think my ""I must get every collectable"" mentality helped with that as I tend to check every corner of each level.

Onto the levels and map design, I think it is very smart and intriguing path they took for a triple a game. It is a sudo metroidvania style which isn't very common in 3D games let alone £50 titles. I think it works brilliantly in this games favour though as you will find areas with things you cannot access then 5 hours later you come back and a whole new section is available. I think the world serpent also plays into this well as he is pretty much a part of the map that moves opening up more areas with more loot. Oh yeah loot there is a lot of loot. From random chests to puzzles to treasure chests the game has a million ways to through ""money"" and crafting materials at you. The puzzles are never anything too complex unless you are missing parts of your brain like me and have to look it up on youtube. I know the term ""crafting"" can scare people away but trust me it's nothing intense, you just collect materials that you give to someone else to make you armour and weapon upgrades. The weapons and amour you do craft are really fun and can have some really big visual differences along with stats but a true chad doesn't care about stats just style.

I will make a small mention of the visuals but you already know they're good just have a look on my steam profile of some of the shots I took during the game and you can see that it is just magnificent in almost every moment.

There you go that's my review on God of War it is 100% worth any amount of money it costs you as it fully lives up to its reputation. As I said at the start one of the best games in the last few years and another brilliant sony exclusive, I hope we get to see more of these on PC soon.

1185,116788877,english,"What an absolute masterpiece. Having played the previous God of War games (including the spin offs) back when I was younger, it was truly a cathartic experience to watch an older, wiser Kratos return in 2018, this time with a son in the frozen forests and tundras of ancient Scandinavia. This new Kratos hasn't been downgraded, instead the writers have turned him into one of the best examples of pure masculine stoicism and wisdom I've seen in any piece of media and depicted one of the best father-son relationships since Cormac McCarthy's The Road. Experiencing this game again on PC only reaffirms why its so excellent. It's world building, art design, narrative, soundtrack, combat and visuals are some of the greatest in the entire medium. Its the kind of game that highlights exactly what the industry is capable of when genuine talent and passion is poured into a project.

1195,116568668,english,"While GoW 2018 diverts away from the conventional hack and slash gameplay the series is known for, it isn't to its detriment. People have been quick to call this a movie-game, but I don't think it should be brushed off as one. Yes, there's more cutscenes in this game than in previous entries, and that's due to the shift in focus. With this shift, almost everything is different. The over the shoulder gameplay, the more frequent cutscenes, and the new Norse setting of Midgard. Some clearly have an issue with it but this game still holds plenty of enjoyment, especially for older GoW fans. Just seeing Kratos try to adjust to this new unfamilair world is really entertaining. His interactions with iconic characters in Norse mythos often strikes anywhere between engaging to just really funny.

Gameplay has been overhauled, with the camera being brought in to the Sony template over the shoulder view. Fighting monsters though is still really enjoyable, with a laundry list of unlockable combos and an axe that can be thrown and called back at a moments notice with 0 cooldown. One real drawback is that upgrades now require more thought and menu navigation than before, and this can cause some headaches. Coupled that with a material gathering system that feels really underutilized.

While initially a Sony exclusive, they have finally ported this to PC. While I was at first bothered that another game has been ported that isn't Bloodborne I was happy to see my 2nd favorite PS4 game make the jump. The team that ported this clearly knew what they were doing as there's tons of extra PC options in settings and updates are still regularly released for this. This feels less like a cash grab and more of a chance for Santa Monica Studio to release a definitive version of this game they put a lot of effort into.

I 100%'d the game and have discovered everything that there is. And after playing the entire series over the last year this one is my favorite. It may have been fatigue from playing the same style of game 5 times before reaching this one, but this really does feel like a breath of fresh air to the series. I understand that some older fans are annoyed that the old hack and slash gameplay is scrapped, but after 6 games I think the developers earned the chance to try something new. Overall I'd recommend picking this up and trying it yourself. One of the best boss fights of the game happens within the first hour so you can use that to gauge if you want to push onwards.",1654511203,1654511203,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,76561198045158912,715,8,2139,0,2139,1649596764,1593500.0
